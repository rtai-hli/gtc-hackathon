# Nonprofit Pivot Implementation Plan

## Vision
Transform the incident response war room from a technical demo into a tool that nonprofit staff can use to report issues, while your AI agents handle the technical investigation behind the scenes.

## User Story
"As a nonprofit program manager with limited technical knowledge, I need to report when our donor database isn't working, so the technical team can fix it without me needing to understand logs, APIs, or system architecture."

---

## Architecture Changes

### Before (Current State)
```
Technical User ‚Üí demo.py ‚Üí Agents ‚Üí Terminal Output
```

### After (Nonprofit-Ready)
```

## New Components to Build

### 1. Nonprofit Interface Layer (`nonprofit_interface.py`)

**Purpose**: Translate between plain language and technical system

**Key Classes**:
```python
class IncidentTranslator:
    """Converts user-friendly descriptions to technical context"""

    def translate_to_technical(self, user_input):
        # "Database isn't working" ‚Üí System metrics + error patterns
        pass

    def translate_from_technical(self, agent_output):
        # Agent reasoning ‚Üí "Found connection issue with database server"
        pass

class StatusSimplifier:
    """Makes agent reasoning human-readable"""

    def get_status_message(self, current_phase):
        # "PHASE_1: Initial Assessment" ‚Üí "üîç Looking into the problem..."
        pass

    def create_summary(self, root_cause, confidence):
        # Technical findings ‚Üí Plain language report
        pass
```

### 2. Web Interface (`web_ui/`)

**Simple Flask/FastAPI app with 2 pages**:

#### A. Report Incident Page
```html
Form fields:
- What were you trying to do? (text)
- What happened instead? (text)
- When did this start? (datetime picker)
- Is this urgent? (Yes/No)
- Screenshot (optional file upload)

[Submit Button] ‚Üí Creates incident, starts investigation
```

#### B. Status Page
```html
Shows:
- Incident ID
- Current status (with emoji)
- Simple progress indicator
- Estimated time to diagnosis
- "View technical details" (link for technical staff)
```

### 3. Notification Bridge (`notifications.py`)

**Sends updates via**:
- Email to technical team
- Slack/Teams webhook (optional)
- SMS for urgent issues (optional)

---

## Modified Existing Components

### `demo.py` ‚Üí `investigation_engine.py`
**Changes**:
- Add `incident_id` parameter
- Add `notify_on_complete` callback
- Return structured results (not just terminal output)
- Add REST API endpoint or queue listener

### `agents/commander.py`
**Changes**:
- Add `simple_summary()` method
- Return confidence level with findings
- Add estimated time remaining
- Track investigation phases for status updates

---

## Data Flow Example

### User Journey:
1. **User submits**: "Our email system stopped sending receipts to donors"

2. **Translation layer converts**:
```json
{
  "incident_id": "INC-001",
  "user_description": "Email system not sending receipts",
  "technical_context": {
    "system": "email_service",
    "symptoms": ["delivery_failure", "receipt_generation"],
    "urgency": "high",
    "affected_users": "donors"
  }
}
```

3. **Agent system investigates** (existing logic)
   - Commander orchestrates
   - Agents analyze logs, metrics, code changes
   - Observable reasoning captured

4. **Status updates** (new):
```
Every 30 seconds:
- üîç "Looking into email system..." (PHASE_1)
- üîé "Checking recent changes..." (PHASE_2)
- üí° "Found possible cause..." (PHASE_3)
- ‚úÖ "Root cause identified" (PHASE_4)
```

5. **Results delivered**:

**To User**:
```
üìß Email System Issue - RESOLVED

What we found:
A recent update changed how email receipts are sent. The system is trying
to send to an old server address that no longer exists.

What we're doing:
Our technical team has been notified and can fix this by updating the
server address in the configuration file.

Expected fix time: 15-30 minutes
```

**To Technical Team**:
```
INCIDENT: INC-001
ROOT CAUSE: Email service configuration pointing to deprecated SMTP server
CONFIDENCE: 85%

Evidence:
- Logs show connection timeout to smtp.old-server.org
- Recent deployment changed email_config.yaml
- Git history shows SMTP_HOST was updated but not applied
- Metrics show 100% delivery failure since 2024-10-29 14:23

Recommended Action:
1. Update email_config.yaml with new SMTP_HOST
2. Restart email-service container
3. Verify with test email

## Plain Language Documentation

### For Nonprofit Staff: User Guide

#### "When to Report an Incident"
Report when:
- ‚úÖ A system isn't working as expected
- ‚úÖ Users are seeing errors
- ‚úÖ Something that worked before is now broken
- ‚úÖ Performance is much slower than usual

Don't report:
- ‚ùå Feature requests ("I wish we could...")
- ‚ùå Questions about how to use something
- ‚ùå Minor cosmetic issues (unless urgent)

#### "How to Write a Good Report"
**Be specific**:
- ‚ùå Bad: "Website is broken"
- ‚úÖ Good: "When I try to submit a donation form, I get an error message"

**Include timing**:
- ‚ùå Bad: "Started recently"
- ‚úÖ Good: "Started this morning around 9:30 AM"

**Describe the impact**:
- ‚ùå Bad: "It's not working"
- ‚úÖ Good: "Donors can't complete their donations - 5 people have called about it"

#### "Understanding the Status Updates"
- üîç **Investigating**: Our system is looking into the problem
- üîé **Analyzing**: Checking logs, code changes, and system health
- üí° **Hypothesis**: Think we found the cause, verifying now
- ‚úÖ **Identified**: Root cause confirmed, technical team notified
- üõ†Ô∏è **In Progress**: Technical team is working on the fix

## Example Scenarios for Testing

### Scenario 1: Database Connection Issue
**User Input**: "Our volunteer tracking system is showing 'Error 500' when I try to add new volunteers"

**Translation**:
```json
{
  "system": "volunteer_management",
  "symptom": "http_500_error",
  "action_attempted": "create_new_record",
  "urgency": "medium"
}
```

**Expected Investigation**: Agents check database connections, recent deployments, error logs

**User-Friendly Result**: "The volunteer system can't connect to the database. We found a configuration issue that happened during last night's update. The technical team can fix this in about 15 minutes."

---

### Scenario 2: Email Delivery Failure
**User Input**: "Donation receipts haven't been going out to donors since this morning. We've gotten 3 calls about it."

**Translation**:
```json
{
  "system": "email_service",
  "symptom": "delivery_failure",
  "timing": "started_morning",
  "impact": "donor_experience",
  "urgency": "high"
}
```

**Expected Investigation**: Agents check SMTP logs, email queue, recent config changes

**User-Friendly Result**: "Email receipts aren't sending because the email server address needs to be updated. This is a quick fix - the technical team can resolve it in under 30 minutes."

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review this plan** with your team
2. **Start with Phase 1** - Build translation layer
3. **Test with mock data** before building web UI
4. **Gather feedback** from a nonprofit user (if available)
5. **Iterate quickly** - hackathon timeline is tight!

## Questions to Answer

Before implementing, consider:

1. **Deployment**: Where will the nonprofit interface run?
   - Cloud service (Vercel, Render)?
   - On-premises server?
   - Desktop app?

2. **Authentication**: How do users log in?
   - Simple password?
   - SSO with their existing system?
   - No auth for MVP?

3. **Notifications**: What channels are realistic?
   - Email only (easiest)?
   - Slack/Teams integration?
   - SMS for emergencies?

4. **Storage**: Where do incidents live?
   - Simple JSON files?
   - SQLite database?
   - Cloud database?
