## 🔧 Technical Details

### Model Configuration
```python
llm_client = create_reasoning_llm(
    model="nvidia/llama-3.3-nemotron-super-49b-v1.5",
    min_thinking_tokens=512,
    max_thinking_tokens=2048
)
```

### API Integration
- **Base URL**: `https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1`
- **API Key**: Loaded from `.env` file (NVIDIA_API_KEY or NGC_API_KEY)
- **Streaming**: Enabled for real-time reasoning display
- **Reasoning Tokens**: Configurable (512-2048 range)

### Backward Compatibility
The system maintains full compatibility with existing components:
- ✅ Event-driven architecture unchanged
- ✅ Visualizer integration works seamlessly
- ✅ Scenario system remains compatible
- ✅ Falls back to rule-based reasoning if LLM unavailable

---

## 📈 Performance Observations

### Response Quality
- **Reasoning Depth**: Significantly deeper analysis than 9B model
- **Accuracy**: Higher confidence scores in determinations
- **Detail**: More comprehensive supporting evidence
- **Actionability**: Better mitigation recommendations

### Response Time
- **Simple Query**: ~5-10 seconds
- **Full Incident Analysis**: ~25-30 seconds
- **Trade-off**: Slower but significantly higher quality output

## 🎯 Next Steps for Hackathon

### Phase 2: Multi-Agent System (30-45 min)
Now that you have an enhanced Commander, implement specialist agents:

1. **System Investigator**
   - Analyze metrics and logs
   - Use 49B model for pattern recognition
   - Submit theories to Commander

2. **Code Detective**
   - Correlate code changes with incidents
   - Analyze git history
   - Provide change impact assessment

3. **Root Cause Synthesizer**
   - Build causal chains
   - Challenge theories
   - Rank hypotheses by evidence

### Phase 3: Enhanced Coordination (30 min)
4. **Theory Board**
   - Implement shared theory management
   - Enable agent debates
   - Commander synthesizes with 49B reasoning

5. **Visual Enhancements**
   - Show model thinking in real-time
   - Display confidence scores
   - Highlight key evidence

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If LLM Initialization Fails

**Error**: "No API key found"
```bash
# Verify API key is set
cat .env | grep API_KEY

# Should show:
NVIDIA_API_KEY=nvapi-...
```

**Error**: "Failed to initialize LLM"
- Check internet connectivity
- Verify API key is valid
- System falls back to rule-based reasoning automatically

### If Responses Are Slow
- This is normal for 49B model (larger = slower but better)
- For faster iterations during development, use `--simple` mode
- Consider using smaller model for quick tests, 49B for demos
