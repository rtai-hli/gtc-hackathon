# 🌐 Web UI Quick Start Guide

## What Was Built

A lightweight, button-based web interface for nonprofit incident reporting with zero typing required.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Flask (if needed)
```bash
pip install flask
```

### 2. Start the Web Server
```bash
python web_app.py
```

### 3. Open in Browser
```
http://localhost:5000
```

## 🎯 User Flow

### Button-Only Interface (No Typing!)

**Step 1: What were you trying to do?**
- 📝 Add a new donor or volunteer
- 📧 Send email receipts or messages
- 🌐 Access our website
- 💳 Process a donation or payment
- 📊 View or export a report
- 🔐 Log in to the system
- ❓ Something else

**Step 2: What happened instead?**
- ❌ Got an error message
- 🐌 Very slow loading
- 🚫 Nothing happened
- ⚠️ Wrong or missing information
- 🔒 Can't log in / access denied
- 💔 Page looks broken
- ❓ Something else

**Step 3: When did this start?**
- ⏱️ Just now (last 5 minutes)
- 🕐 Within the last hour
- 📅 Earlier today
- 📆 Yesterday
- 📋 A few days ago
- ❓ Not sure

**Step 4: Is this urgent?**
- 🚨 Yes - Users are affected right now
- ⏰ No - Can wait, not blocking anyone

**Investigation Page:**
- Animated progress with status updates
- Auto-redirects to results after 5 seconds

**Results Page:**
- ✅ Plain language summary
- 📱 **Copy-to-clipboard** text message for tech team
- One-click copy button
- Ready to paste into SMS/messaging app

---

## 💡 Key Features

### 1. Zero Typing Required
- All input via button clicks
- No forms to fill out
- Quick and accessible

### 2. Copy-to-Text Feature
Instead of asking "do you want to see technical details?", the results page shows:

```
📱 Text the Tech Team

[Copyable text box with:]
🚨 INCIDENT INC-20241029153045

System: DATABASE
Urgency: HIGH

Issue: Database connection pool exhaustion due to configuration change

Est. fix time: 15-30 minutes

Check dashboard for full details.

[📋 Copy Message] ← One-click copy button
```

User clicks button → Message copied → Paste into phone/Slack/Teams

### 3. Clean UI Without Styling
- Minimal CSS (easy to replace)
- Functional layout
- Mobile-responsive
- Ready for your design system

## 🔧 How It Works

### Backend Flow
```python
User clicks buttons
    ↓
Flask stores choices in session
    ↓
After final button → Create IncidentReport
    ↓
Translate to TechnicalContext
    ↓
Simulate investigation (or call real agents)
    ↓
Generate TWO summaries:
  1. User-friendly (plain language)
  2. Text message (concise, copy-ready)
    ↓
Display results with copy button
```

### Copy-to-Clipboard Implementation
```javascript
// Modern clipboard API with fallback
navigator.clipboard.writeText(text)
    .then(() => {
        // Show success feedback
        button.innerHTML = '✅ Copied!';
    })
    .catch(() => {
        // Fallback for older browsers
        useTextAreaMethod();
    });
```

## 🎨 Customization Points

### Change Button Options
Edit the HTML templates (`step1.html`, `step2.html`, etc.):

```html
<button type="submit" name="what_trying" value="Your custom option">
    🎯 Your Custom Button Text
</button>
```

### Modify Text Message Format
Edit `web_app.py` → `generate_text_summary()`:

```python
def generate_text_summary(incident_id, system, urgency, root_cause, fix_time):
    summary = f"""YOUR CUSTOM FORMAT HERE

Incident: {incident_id}
System: {system}
...
"""
    return summary
```

### Add Your Styling
Replace the `<style>` blocks in templates with your CSS framework:
- Bootstrap
- Tailwind
- Material UI
- Your custom design system

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Complete Flow
1. Start server: `python web_app.py`
2. Open: `http://localhost:5000`
3. Click through all 4 steps
4. Watch investigation animation
5. See results page
6. Click "Copy Message" button
7. Paste into notepad/messaging app to verify

### Test Different Scenarios
**Scenario 1: Database Error (High Urgency)**
- Step 1: Add a new donor
- Step 2: Got an error message
- Step 3: Just now
- Step 4: Yes (urgent)

**Scenario 2: Email Issue (Medium Urgency)**
- Step 1: Send email receipts
- Step 2: Nothing happened
- Step 3: Earlier today
- Step 4: No (not urgent)

**Scenario 3: Slow Website (Low Urgency)**
- Step 1: Access our website
- Step 2: Very slow loading
- Step 3: A few days ago
- Step 4: No

---

## 🔗 Integration with Real Agents

### Replace Mock Investigation
In `web_app.py`, replace `simulate_investigation()`:

```python
def simulate_investigation(technical_context):
    # OLD: Mock findings
    # return mock_findings.get(system, {...})

    # NEW: Call your real agent system
    from scenario_adapter import create_scenario_from_context
    from agents.commander import IncidentCommander

    scenario = create_scenario_from_context(technical_context)
    commander = IncidentCommander()
    agent_results = await commander.run(scenario)

    return format_results_for_translation(agent_results)
```

## 🎬 Demo Script

### For Hackathon Presentation

**1. Introduction (30 seconds)**
"We built a button-based interface that anyone can use - no typing required, just click through four simple questions."

**2. Live Demo (2 minutes)**
- Show landing page: "Report an Incident"
- Click through: database → error message → just now → urgent
- Show investigation animation
- **Highlight**: "Results page with one-click copy"
- Click "Copy Message" button
- Show copied text in notepad/phone

**3. Key Innovation (30 seconds)**

**4. Value Proposition**
"This makes AI-powered incident response accessible to everyone - no technical knowledge, no typing, just buttons and copy-paste."
