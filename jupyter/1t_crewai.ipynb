    "### Defining An Agent Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether you fully appreciate it or not, both of the systems demonstrated in notebook 1a were, in fact, **agent systems**. They were software systems where at least one software component semantically percieved the environment and responded to the best of their ability to satisfy a vague objective.\n",
    "- The basic chat loop was literally just a loop that sampled responses from the LLM and the user in a loop. The environment is the message bus, the agents are you and the LLM, and the process was represented by the responses flowing between the agents.\n",
    "- The local-perspective systems, also defined in a loop, were very similar but had better support for modeling multiple destinct personas. They mapped from some global state system into something the LLM was suited to handle, and mapped back up to the global state in the same manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "We were technically relying on the LangChain software stack to connect to our model below a plethora of abstractions, but we really were just using some simple primitives to make our agent systems work. The real interesting parts involved the organization of these primitives to create synergized components that made it easy for our agents - or even humans - to communicate appropriately. \n",
    "\n",
    "**In this notebook, we will briefly introduce CrewAI as a potential framework of interest.** Though the course will not use CrewAI much - and we will explain why shortly - it is important to understand:\n",
    "- What CrewAI is.\n",
    "- What problems CrewAI solves.\n",
    "- Why might people choose to use it."

    "<!-- > **CrewAI is a cutting-edge framework for orchestrating autonomous AI agents.**\n",
    "> \n",
    "> CrewAI enables you to create AI teams where each agent has specific roles, tools, and goals, working together to accomplish complex tasks.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Think of it as assembling your dream team - each member (agent) brings unique skills and expertise, collaborating seamlessly to achieve your objectives. -->\n",
    "\n",
    "As advertised, **CrewAI** is a well-built and general-purpose multi-agent framework, which roughly means it has:\n",
    "- A mechanism for communication that it enforces.\n",
    "- Some core workflows that it advertises to streamline.\n",
    "- Some primitives defined to make those workflows easy to execute on.\n",
    "- Paths towards productionalization for multi-tenant and concurrent execution. (*more on that later*)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the section below, we will take advantage of some of its built-in primitives and investigate how this system operates and consider when we might use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **The CrewAI Mind Map**\n",
    "\n",
    "Like all frameworks, CrewAI enforces some opinions about how an agent system should be structured/which kinds it best supports as first-class abstractions. Here is the latest version of their working mind-map for those taking a first-look at this framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/crewai-mindmap.png\" style=\"width: 800px\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever you see something like this, understand that this is **a potential way** to think about the agent abstractions. Every potential option has its pros and cons, and there is a reason why we think it's important to advocate for CrewAI while also not teach explicitly to a specific option.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be clear, their abstractions are more than enough to execute on the processes covered in the scope of this course, and we encourage you to try it out for yourself with more involved use-cases after the class!"

For example, the following cells show a typical construction of a minimal CrewAI `Crew`, or agent pool that work towards an objective:\n",
    "\n",
    "> You can define one or more CrewAI [**`Agents`**](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/agents), which are persona-based agents that communicates with other Agents. Combined with the `Prompts` utility abstraction, the `task_execution()` method gives you a base prompt for the agent (which can be added to by other mechanisms later).\n",
    "> \n",
    "> In contrast, the [**`Task`**](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/tasks) abstraction specifies actual directives for your agents to execute on. This requires a different set of arguments, encapsulates `Agent` entities to communicate which ones can work on the process, and computes an appropriate prompt component via the `.prompt()` method.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> And to top it off, the [**`Crew`**](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/crews) abstraction contains both `Task`s and `Agent`s, and allows them to communicate (via a `Process` class) in a sequential or hierarchical manner to achieve the list of `Tasks`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Said more plainly, the CrewAI abstraction has you:**\n",
    "- **Defining agents** that have personas, backgrounds, and generic goals.\n",
    "- **Defining tasks** that can be executed by a subset of agents in some manner.\n",
    "- **Defining crews** of agents that work on groups of tasks with various witness mechanisms.\n",
