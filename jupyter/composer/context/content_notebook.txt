<h2><b>Notebook 1:</b> Making A Simple Agent</h2>
<br>

**Hello, and welcome to the first notebook of the course!**

We will use this opportunity to introduce some starting tools to build a simple chat system and will contextualize their place within the agent classification space. Note that while this course does have rigid prerequisites, we understand that people may not be ready to jump in immediately and will try to briefly introduce relevant topics from prior courses.

### **Learning Objectives:**

**In this notebook, we will:**
- Gain a working understanding of the term "agent," and understand why it is once again gaining traction.
- Explore the course primitives, including the NIM Llama model running in the background of this environment.
- Make a simple chatbot, followed by a simple multi-agent system to allow for multi-turn multi-persona dialog.

## **Part 1:** Boiling Down Agents

**In the lecture, we defined an agent as an entity among entities that exists and functions in an environment.** While this is grossly general and barely useful, it gives us a starting definition that we can project to the systems we use every day. Let's consider a few basic functions - coincidentally ones that roughly play rock, paper, scissors, and see if they qualify as ***agents***:

```python
from random import randint

def greet(state):
    return print("Let's play a nice game of Rock/Paper/Scissors") or "nice"

def play(state):
    match randint(1, 3):
        case 1: return print("I choose rock") or "rock"
        case 2: return print("I choose paper") or "paper"
        case 3: return print("I choose scissors") or "scissors"

def judge(state):
    play_pair = state.get("my_play"), state.get("your_play")
    options = "rock", "paper", "scissors"
    ## Create pairs of options such as [(o1, o2), (o2, o3), (o3, o1)]
    loss_pairs = [(o1, o2) for o1, o2 in zip(options, options[1:] + options[:1])]
    ## Create pairs of options such as [(o2, o1), (o3, o2), (o1, o3)]
    win_pairs  = [(o2, o1) for o1, o2 in loss_pairs]
    if play_pair in loss_pairs:
        return print("I lost :(") or "user_wins"
    if play_pair in win_pairs:
        return print("I win :)") or "ai_wins"
    return print("It's a tie!") or "everyone_wins"

state = {}
state["my_tone"] = greet(state)
state["my_play"] = play(state)
state["your_play"] = input("Your Play").strip() or print("You Said: ", end="") or play(state)
state["result"] = judge(state)

print(state)
```

<br>

Together, they trivially define a computer program and technically interact with an environment of sorts:
- The **computer** renders the user interface for the human to interact with.
- The **Jupyter cell** stores lines of code which help to define a control flow that executes when the system runs.
- The **Python environment** stores variables, including function and state, and even the output buffer that gets rendered for the user.
- The **state dictionary** stores a state that can be written to.
- The **functions** take in the state dictionary, possibly act on it, and print/return values which may or may not be honored.
- ... so on and so forth.

There are obviously arbitrarily many things at play that contribute to the state of this system and that of the larger surrounding world, and yet nothing here nor there fully considers or even understands all of them. **All that matters is what's locally percieved, and this local perception drives local actions.** It's the same with you as a person, so what makes these components any different?

Well, the main difference here is that these components *do not feel* like they are meaningfully percieving the environment and intentionally choosing their actions. Put another way:
- The decomposition of a complex problem into modules of state and functionality glued together with some control flow defines good software engineering...
- But the *feeling* that components have the choice to do things and are driven by some tangible objective define our intuitive *agent* in a human sense. 

Since humans interact with the environment through the local perception of senses and reason about it semantically (through "thought" and "meaning"), an agent system that interacts with humans would need to either look and act in our shared physical space as a **physical agent**, or communicate like a human or persona would through a limited interface as a **digital agent**. But if it is to function *alongside* humans and *think* like a human, it would need to:
- At least be able to sustain some notion of internal thought and local perspective.
- Have some understanding of its environment and the notion of "goals" and "tasks."
- Be able to communicate through an interface that can be understood by a human.

These are all concepts that float around in **semantic space** - they have "meaning" and "causality" and "implications", and can be interpretted by humans and even algorithms when organized correctly - so we will need to be able to model these semantic concepts and create mappings from semantically-dense inputs to semantically-dense outputs. This is exactly where large language models come in.

<hr><br>

## **Part 2:** Semantic Reasoning with Technology

In most cases, software is programmed into intuitive modules that can be built upon to make complex systems. Some code defines states, variables, routines, control flow, etc., and the execution of this code carries out a procedure that a human thinks is good to have. The components are described, have meaning in their construction and function, and piece together logically because the developer decided to put them that way or because the structure emerged otherwise:

```python
from math import sqrt                             ## Import of complex environment resources

def fib(n):                                       ## Function to describe and encapsulate
    """Closed-form fibonacci via golden ratio"""  ## Semantic description to simplify
    return round(((1 + sqrt(5))/2)**n / sqrt(5))  ## Repeatable operation that users need not know

for i in range(10):                               ## Human-specified control flow
    print(fib(i))
```

With large language models trained on a giant repository of data, we can model the mapping from a semantically-meaningful input to a semantically-meaningful output with the power of inference.

**Specifically, the two main models we will care about are:**
- **Encoding Model:** $Enc: X \to R^{n}$, which maps input that has intuitive explicit form (i.e. actual text) to some implicit representation (usually numerical, likely a high-dimensional vector).
- **Decoding Model:** $Dec: R^{n}\cup X \to Y$, which maps input from some representation (maybe vector, maybe explicit) into some explicit representation.

These are highly-general constructs and various architectures can be made to implement them. For example, you may be familiar with the following formulations:
- **Text-Generating LLM:** $text \to text$ might be implemented with a forecasting model that is trained to predict one token after another. For example, $P(t_{m..m+n} | t_{0..m-1})$ might generate a series of $n$ tokens (substrings) from $m$ tokens by iterating on $P(t_{i} | t_{0..i-1})$ starting at $i=m$.
- **Vision LM:** $\{text, image\} \to text$ might be implemented as $Dec(Enc_1(text), Enc_2(image))$ where $Dec$ is has viable architecture for sequence modeling and $Enc_1/Enc_2$ just projects the natural inputs into a latent form.
- **Diffusion Model:** $\{text\} \to image$ might be implemented as $Dec(...(Dec(Dec(\xi_0))...)$ where $Dec$ iteratively denoises from a canvas of noise while also taking in some encoding $Enc(text)$ as conditioning.

For most of this course, we will mainly rely on a decoder-style (implied autoregressive) large language model which is running perpetually in the background of this environment. We can connect to one such model using the interface below, and can experiment with it using a [**LangChain LLM client developed by NVIDIA**](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/nvidia_ai_endpoints/) - which is really just a client that works with any OpenAI-style LLM endpoint with a few extra conveniences.

```python
from langchain_nvidia import ChatNVIDIA
## Uncomment to list available models
# model_options = [m.id for m in ChatNVIDIA.get_available_models()]
# print(model_options)

llm = ChatNVIDIA(model="meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct", base_url="http://llm_client:9000/v1")
```

This model, which is a [**Llama-8B-3.1-Instruct NIM-hosted model**](https://build.nvidia.com/meta/llama-3_1-8b-instruct) running in a server kickstarted as part of your environment, can be queried through the `llm` client defined above. We can send a single request to the model as follows, either with a single response which gets delivered all at once or a streamed response that creates a generator and outputs as tokens are produced.

```python
%%time
print("[SINGLE RESPONSE]")
print(llm.invoke("Hello World").content)
```

```python
%%time
print("[STREAMED RESPONSE]")
for chunk in llm.stream("Hello world"):
    print(chunk.content, end="", flush=True)
```

**From a technical perspective,** Between this simple request and the simple response lies layers of abstraction which include:
- A network request sent out to the `llm_client` microservice running a FastAPI router service.
- A network request sent out to a `nim` microservice running another FastAPI service and hosting a VLLM/Triton-backed model downloaded from a model registry.
- An insertion of the inputs into some prompt template that the model was actually trained for.
- A tokenization of the input from the templated string into a sequence of classes using something resembling the transformers preprocessing pipeline.
- An embedding of the inputted sequence of classes into some latent form using an embedding routine.
- A propogation of the input embeddings through a transformer-backed architecture to progressively convert the input embeddings into the output embeddings.
- And a progressive decoding of next tokens, sampled from the predicted probability over all token options, one at a time, until a stop token is generated.
- ... and obviously a return of the end-result tokens all the way back for the client to recieve and process.

**From our perspective,** our client facilitated the connection to a large language model through a network interface to - at minimum - send out a well-formatted request and accept a well-formatted response, as shown below:

```python
llm._client.last_inputs
```

```python
## Note, the client does not attempt to log 
llm._client.last_response.json()
```

<br>

**Is this model inherently "thinking?"** Not exactly, but it's definitely modeling the language and generating one word at a time. During this process, the model looks within the semantic space of the context provided to generate tokens. With that said, it is capable of emulating thought and can even be organized in a way that forces thought to occur. ***More on that later.***

**Does this mean this model is an "agent?"** Also not exactly. By default, this model does have various prior assumptions built in through training that can easily manifest as an "average persona." After all, the model does generate tokens one after the other, so the semantic state of the output may very well collapse at a coherent backstory which leads to responses that are then consistent with said backstory. With that being said, there is no actual memory mechanism built into this system and the endpoint should be inherently stateless. 

We can send some requests to the model to see how it works below:

```python
from langchain_nvidia import NVIDIA

## This is a more typical interface which accepts chat messages (or implicitly creates them)
print("Trying out some different /chat/completions sampling")
print(llm.bind(seed=42).invoke("Hello world").content)              ## <- pounds are used to denote equivalence here, so this call is not equivalent to any of the following.
print(llm.bind(seed=12).invoke("Hello world").content)              ### Changing the seed changes the sampling. This is usually subtle. 
print(llm.bind(seed=12).invoke("Hello world").content)              ### Same seed + same input = same sampling.
print(llm.bind(seed=12).invoke([("user", "Hello world")]).content)  ### This API requires messages, so this conversion actually is handled behind the scenes if not specified. 
print(llm.bind(seed=12).invoke("Hello world!").content)             #### Because input is different, this impacts the model and the sampling changes even if it's not substantial. 
print(llm.bind(seed=12).invoke("Hemlo wordly!").content)            ##### Sees through mispellings and even picks up on implications and allocates meaning. 

## This queries the underlying model using the completions API
base_llm = NVIDIA(model="nvidia/mistral-nemo-minitron-8b-base", base_url="http://llm_client:9000/v1")
print("\nTrying out some different `/completions` sampling. Supported by NIMs, hidden by build.nvidia.com unless typical-use.")
print(f"Models with /completions as typical-use:")
print(*[f" - {repr(m)}" for m in base_llm.get_available_models()], sep="\n")
print("\n[Hello world]" + base_llm.bind(seed=42, max_tokens=20).invoke("Hello world").replace("\n", " ")) ######
print("\n[Hello world]" + base_llm.bind(seed=12, max_tokens=20).invoke("Hello world").replace("\n", " ")) #######
```

<br>

**So what exactly is it good for?** Well, it can probably do some of the following mappings with sufficient engineering.
- **User Question -> Answer**
- **User Question + History -> Answer**
- **User Request -> Function Argument**
- **User Request -> Function Selection + Function Argument**
- **User Question + Computed Context -> Context-Guided Answer**
- **Directive -> Internal Thought**
- **Directive + Internal Thought -> Python Code**
- **Directive + Internal Thought + Priorly-Ran Python Code -> More Python Code**
- ...

The list goes on and on. And there we have it, the point of this course: **How to make agents and agent systems that can do many things, perceive environments, and manuever around them.** (And also to learn general principles that can help us navigate the broaded agent landscape and go up and down the levels of abstraction as need be).

<hr><br>

## **Part 3:** Defining Our First Minimally-Viable Stateful LLM

We will be using [**LangChain**](https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/llm_chain/) as our point of lowest abstraction and will try to limit our course to only the following interfaces: 
- **`ChatPromptTemplate`:** Takes in a list of messages with variable placeholders on construction (message list template). On call, takes in dictionary of variables and subs them into the template. Out comes a list of messages.
- **`ChatNVIDIA`, `NVIDIAEmbedding`, `NVIDIARerank`:** Clients that let us connect to LLM resources. Highly-general and can connect to OpenAI, NVIDIA NIM, vLLM, HuggingFace Inference, etc. 
- **`StrOutputParser`, `PydanticOutputParser`:** Takes the responses from a chat model and converts them into some other format (i.e. just get the content of the response, or create an object).
- **`Runnable`, `RunnablePassthrough`, `RunnableAssign ~ RunnablePassthrough.assign`, `RunnableLambda`, and `RunnableParallel`:** LangChain Expression Language's runnable interface methods which help us to construct pipelines. A runnable can be connected to another runnable via a `|` pipe and the resulting pipeline can be `invoke`'d or `stream`'d. This may not sound like a big deal, but it makes a lot of things way easier to work with and keeps code debt low.

All of these are runnables and have convenience methods to make some things nicer, but they also don't overly-abstract many of the details and help to keep developers in control. Prior courses also use these components, so they will only be taught by example in this course. 

Given these components, we can create a stateful definition of our first LLM-powered function: **a simple system message generator** to define the overall behavior and functionality of the model in the context of a given interaction. 

```python
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser
from langchain_nvidia import ChatNVIDIA
from copy import deepcopy

#######################################################################
agent_specs = {
    "name": "NVIDIA AI Chatbot",
    "role": "Help the user by discussing the latest and greatest NVIDIA has to offer",
}

sys_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    ("user", "Please make an effective system message for the following agent specification: {agent_spec}"),
])

## Print model input
print(repr(sys_prompt.invoke({"agent_spec": str(agent_specs)})), '\n')

## Print break
print('-'*40)

chat_chain = (
    sys_prompt 
    | llm 
    | StrOutputParser()
)
print(chat_chain.invoke({"agent_spec": str(agent_specs)}))
```

<br>

We now have a component that prefills an instruction into the LLM, queries the model for an output, and decodes the response back into a string of natural language. Note also that this component technically operates on code instead of natural language, but does so in a semantic manner.

That's pretty cool... **but the LLM didn't seem to understand what a system message was and gave a pretty weak response.**

This strongly suggests that the model is not inherently self-aware of **system messages** and their intended use, or does not associate system messages as "LLM-centric directives" by default. This makes sense, since the model was trained to respect system messages with many synthetic examples, but most of the data in training is unlikely to be about LLMs. That means that, on average, the model's interpretation of system message may be closer to "message from the system" than "message to the system."

To better parameterize the model, we will use the **system** directive, which is weighted heavily during training and is advertised as a spot for you to put overarching meta-instructions. To generate a good one, all we need to do it prime the model to think about LLMs and explaining our expectations, and perhaps that's all that's necessary...

```python
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

sys_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    ("system", 
         "You are an expert LLM prompt engineering subsystem specialized in producing compact and precise system messages "
         "for a Llama-8B-style model. Your role is to define the chatbot's behavior, scope, and style in a third-person, "
         "directive format. Avoid using conversational or self-referential language like 'I' or 'I'm,' as the system message is "
         "meant to instruct the chatbot, not simulate a response. Output only the final system message text, ensuring it is "
         "optimized to align the chatbot's behavior with the agent specification."
    ),
    ("user", "Please create an effective system message for the following agent specification: {agent_spec}")
])

## Print model input
print(repr(sys_prompt.invoke({"agent_spec": str(agent_specs)})), '\n')

## Print break
print('-'*40)

chat_chain = sys_prompt | llm | StrOutputParser()
print(chat_chain.invoke({"agent_spec": str(agent_specs)}))
```

<br>

**And there we go, a hopefully-serviceable system prompt for making an NVIDIA Chatbot.**
- Feel free to change the directive as you see fit, but the output will likely work just fine.
- When you get a system message you're happy with, paste it below and see what happens as you query the system.

```python
## TODO: Try using your own system message generated from the model
sys_msg = """

sys_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([("system", sys_msg), ("placeholder", "{messages}")])
state = {
    "messages": [("user", "Who are you? What can you tell me?")],
    # "messages": [("user", "Hello friend! What all can you tell me about RTX?")],

## Print break
print('*'*40)

chat_chain = sys_prompt | llm | StrOutputParser()

for chunk in chat_chain.stream(state):
    print(chunk, end="", flush=True)
```

<br>

Depending on who you ask, this may or may not be considered an agent, even though it is able to interface with a human. It also may or may not be useful, depending on your objectives. Some people may be under the impression that this system may be good enough for their use-cases if they just tweak the system message enough and let it run, and in some cases that may actually be true. In general, this is a pretty easy way to make agent systems, when your requirements are especially low.

**For this course,** we will use this interface as-is, customize it as necessary, and consider which modifications need to be made to actually make this system work well for us. Below are a few key concepts to know regarding prompt engineering: 
* **Messages** are the individual pieces of text that communicate with the language model during the interaction. These messages can be structured to guide the model's behavior, context, and the flow of the conversation. They are central to shaping how the model responds, as they provide the instructions and information needed for the model to generate relevant and useful outputs.
* **System message** provides overarching instructions or directives that set the tone, behavior, or context for the entire interaction. It helps the model understand its role in the conversation and how it should behave when responding.
* **User message** is the input provided by the user, requesting information, asking a question, or directing the model to complete a specific task.
* **Role message** can be used to define the role the model should take when responding to a user's request. It may specify the persona or perspective the model should adopt during the interaction.
* **Assistant message** is the response generated by the model based on the user message (and any system or role instructions). It contains the output or information that the model provides to the user in reply to the prompt.

<hr><br>

## **Part 4:** The Trivial Multi-Turn Chatbot

Now that we have our single-response pipeline, we can wrap it in one of the easiest control flows possible: *an infinitely-running while loop that breaks when no input is reached.* 

> <img src="images/basic-loop.png" width=1000px>

This section shows an opinionated version which is definitely over-engineered towards the standard output use-case, but is also representative of the (hidden) abstraction layer you'll find in most frameworks. 

**Take note of the following design decisions and meta-perspectives:**
- The effective environment is defined in terms of the list of messages.
    - The LLM and the user share the same environment, and both can directly contribute to it only by writing to the message buffer. (The user can also stop it)
    - The agent and the user will both help to influence the length, formality, and quality of the discussion as the chat progresses.
    - The agent has full view of this environment (i.e. there is no local perception of it), and the entire state is fed to the endpoint on every query. The next notebook will consider an alternative formulation.
    - The human only sees the last message at a time (though they can also scroll up).
- The state is front-loaded and the pipeline is largely stateless on its own. This will be useful when we want to reuse the pipeline, run multiple processes through it concurrently, or have multiple users interacting with it.
- While the system can accept >10k tokens of context, it is not likely to produce more than 2k per query and will tend to be much shorter on average. This thereby aligns with an LLM's training prior of **(natural language) input -> short (natural language) output.** 

```python
sys_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    ("system", sys_msg + "\nPlease make short responses"), 
    ("placeholder", "{messages}")
])

def chat_with_human(state, label="User"):
    return input(f"[{label}]: ")

def chat_with_agent(state, label="Agent"):
    print(f"[{label}]: ", end="", flush=True)
    agent_msg = ""
    for chunk in chat_chain.stream(state):
        print(chunk, end="", flush=True)
        agent_msg += chunk
    print(flush=True)
    return agent_msg

state = {
    # "messages": [],
    "messages": [("ai", "Hello Friend! How can I help you today?")],
}

chat_chain = sys_prompt | llm | StrOutputParser()

while True:
    state["messages"] += [("user", chat_with_human(state))]
    ## If not last message contains text
    if not state["messages"][-1][1].strip():
        print("End of Conversation. Breaking Loop")
        break
    state["messages"] += [("ai", chat_with_agent(state))]
```

```python
## Print and review state
print(state)
```

<br>

**Can we make it chat with itself?** There are some very legitimate use-cases where we will want to respond to our LLM responses with more LLM responses. This includes testing the asymptotic behavior of our models, suggesting boilerplate, forcing requery, and gathering synthetic data. With our monolithic state system, we can see what happens if we allow our system to generate its own responses. 

This will actually work surprisingly well, but is technically testing the system with some out-of-domain use-cases. 
- For one thing, the LLM chat endpoint includes formatting that may create some inconsistencies, such as inserting a start-of-ai-message-like substring at the end of your message.
- More problematically, the querying system is likely tainted with a conflicting system message, and the lack of reinforcement regarding its role will cause some mix-ups.

On the other hand, there is also an odd property where the LLM will follow the patterns set by its input, so success in the recent and average context may be enough to cause the system to stabilize and repeat its pattern of success. 

We have modified the code slightly for the below exercise. Providing a blank input will cause the LLM to "respond as a human" while the input "stop" will end the conversation. 

```python
state = {
    "messages": [("ai", "Hello Jane! How can I help you today?")],
}

print("[Agent]:", state["messages"][0][1])
chat_chain = sys_prompt | llm | StrOutputParser()

## Print model input
# print(chat_chain.invoke(state))

while True:
    state["messages"] += [("user", chat_with_human(state))]
    ## If last message is "stop"
    if state["messages"][-1][1].lower() == "stop":
        print("End of Conversation. Breaking Loop")
        break
    ## If not last message contains text
    elif not state["messages"][-1][1].strip():
        del state["messages"][-1]
        state["messages"] += [("user", chat_with_agent(state, label="Pretend User") + " You are responding as human.")]
    state["messages"] += [("ai", chat_with_agent(state))]
```

```python
## Print and review state
for role, msg in state['messages']: 
    print(f'[{role}]: {msg} \n') 
```

<br>

**NOTES:** 
- What do you observe? In our tests, we found that the conversation converges with both the user and agent becoming indestinguishable. Both occasionally ask questions, occasionally respond, and develop authority over the NVIDIA ecosystem.
- Notice how we set the LLM's first AI message to address you as Jane (from "Jane Doe"). Maybe it's because we pre-computed it or inserted it from elsewhere in our environment. Try asking it what your name is? What is its name? Why did it call you that? The explanations should be interesting.

<hr>
<br>

## **Part 5:** From Monolithic To Local Perception

Now that we have a monolithic state system, let's consider the use-case of first-class multi-persona simulation. We would like to put several personas into an environment and see where the conversation goes, and we want this to be a bit deeper than our shallow "share the system message and just keep going" exercise above. This kind of setup is useful for long-horizon reasoning evaluation, where an LLM system developer might pair their application with one or more AI-driven user personas and see where it goes. 

Let's break our definition into the following components: 
- **Environment:** This is the pool of values which are necessary for a module to perform its functionality. This can also be called a **state**.
- **Process:** This is the operation which that acts on an environment/state.
- **Execution:** This is the execution of a process on an environment which hopefully does something.

With these in mind, let's set up a persona management system using some familiar principles. 

```python
from copy import deepcopy

#########################################################################

    ("system", "You are a {sender} having a meeting with your {recipient} (Conversation Participants: {roles}). {directive}"),
    ("placeholder", "{messages}"),
    ("user", "Please respond to {recipient} as {sender}"),

We've set up a pretty basic system with some new formalizations, and honestly came up with a pretty similar result:

**There is only a single state system that represents the entirety of the environment.**

Conceptually, this isn't too different from the way you usually implement chatbots - recall that there is usually only a single history loop which gets constructed progressively and occasionally hits an LLM as input. This makes a lot of sense, since it's easier to maintain a single state system and then format it for the requirements of your functions:
- For the LLM, you want to convert the state into a list of messages with the "ai" or "user" role with maybe some other parameters.
- For the user, you want to convert the state into something that would render cleanly for a user interface.
- For both systems, the underlying data is the same, if a bit processed. 

This one is just abstracted to be much more obvious in its limitations.

<br>

### **Jumping To Multi-State**

Using a single-state system, we're going to have some trouble extending our setup to maintain multiple personas. Consider two agents that are talking with each other, we have some options regarding how we set up our state mechanism:

- **Mapping An Accumulating Global Environment to Local Environments:** Assuming a single conversation with many agents, we could have a single state system that gets reformatted for each agent. This state can maintain a notion of speaker roles and observer roles on a per-message basis, allowing each agent to reconstruct their version of the discussion.
- **Remembering Observations From Ephemeral Global Streams:** We could set up our agents to each have their own state systems, and each conversation contributes to every witnessing agent's state systems. In this case, the agents will be highly stateful and will have an internal memory of transactions. With this "memory" as the single source of truth, we may experience drift as our system becomes more complex and we add modification pipelines to our agents. With that said, I guess it's more human-like, right?
    - **Note:** To make this system work, there has to be a witness mechanism in place. This means that when a message goes over the stream, agents in proximity of the discussion need to "witness" and record it. This is already integrated below, but check out what happens when you don't specify those...

> <img src="images/basic-multi-agent.png" width=700px>

The following implements both options, with the central state being the major divide between the two techniques. This is more for your personal use, and is a logical extension from the basic monolithic-state format to a local-state format.

```python
from functools import partial

def get_messages(p1, central_state=None):
    ## If central_state is being used
    if central_state is None:
        return p1["messages"]
    else: ## Unified state must be processed to conform to each agent
        return list(
            ## Messages from non-speaker are Assistant messages
            ("user" if speaker==p1["sender"] else "ai", f"[{speaker}] {content}") 
            for speaker, content in central_state
        )

def update_states(p1, message, witnesses=[], central_state=None):
    speaker = p1["sender"]
    if central_state is None: 
        p1["messages"] += [("ai", f"[{speaker}] {message}")]
        ## Updates state for witnesses
        for agent in witnesses:
            if agent["sender"] != speaker:
                agent["messages"] += [("user", f"[{speaker}] {message}")]
    else: ## Unified state makes it much easier to lodge an update from an arbitrary agent
        central_state += [(speaker, f"{message}")]

def clean_message(message):
    message = message.strip()
    if not message: return ""
    if message.startswith("["):
        message = message[message.index("]")+1:].strip()
    if message.startswith("("):
        message = message[message.index(")")+1:].strip()
    if message[0] in ("'", '"') and message[0] == message[-1]:
        message = message.replace(message[0], "")
    return message

def interact_fn(p1, p2, witnesses=[], central_state=None):
    p1["recipient"] = p2["sender"]
    p1["messages"] = get_messages(p1, central_state)
    ## Get next interaction from p1 to p2
    message = clean_message(get_next_interaction(p1))
    update_states(p1=p1, message=message, witnesses=witnesses, central_state=central_state)
    return
    
teacher = get_state(sender="teacher")
student = get_state(sender="student")
parent = get_state(sender="parent")
teacher["roles"] = student["roles"] = parent["roles"] = "teacher, student, parent"

## Option 1: Have each agent record a local state from the global state stream
##           No global state
# interact = partial(interact_fn, witnesses=[teacher, student, parent])
interact = partial(interact_fn, witnesses=[])  ## No witnesses. You will note that the conversations becomes... superficially average but incoherent
get_msgs = get_messages

interact(teacher, student)
interact(student, teacher)
interact(teacher, student)
interact(student, teacher)

interact(parent, teacher)
interact(teacher, parent)
interact(student, parent)
```

```python
## Option 2: Using a central state and having each agent interpret from it
central_state = [
    ("student", "Hello Mr. Doe! Thanks for the class session today! I had a question about my performance on yesterday's algorithms exam...")
]

interact = partial(interact_fn, central_state=central_state)
get_msgs = partial(get_messages, central_state=central_state)

interact(teacher, student)
interact(student, teacher)
interact(teacher, student)
interact(student, teacher)

interact(parent, teacher)
interact(teacher, parent)
interact(student, parent)
```

```python
get_msgs(parent)
```

### **Part 6:** Wrapping Up

We've now seen both the monolithic and local interpretations of state management, which... shouldn't be too impressive. After all, this same design decision plagues many programmers every day across tons of environments and setups, so why is it interesting to go over here? 

Well, it's because just about every agentic system uses this kind of parameterization loop to make its LLM queries: 
- We convert from global state to a local perception that is good for the LLM.
- We use the LLM to output a reasonable local action based on its perspective.
- And then we apply the action onto the global state as a modification.

Even if the LLM is extremely powerful and well-behaved, there is some global environment which it can never tackle. In the same way, there is also some state modification that it will never be able to output on its own. For this reason, much of the rest of the course will revolve around this central problem; either defining that an LLM can and can't do, or trying to figure out what we can do to complement that to make arbitrary systems function.

**Now that you're done with this notebook:**
- **In the next Exercise notebook:** We will take a step back and try to use our LLM to do reason about a "slightly-too-large" global state, and see what all is necessary to make it min-viable for working with it.
- **In the next Tangent notebook:** We will look at a more opinionated framework to achieve our same multi-turn multi-agent setup, **CrewAI**, and consider pros and cons surrounding it.

<h2><b>Exercise 1:</b> Dataset Chat</h2>
<br>

**Welcome back! This is the first exercise in the course, so see what you can do!**

This notebook serves as a hands-on exercise following the "main-lecture" notebook. The exercises in this series utilizes the same dataset to gradually help us enable more complex LLM interactions.

In the previous notebook, we implemented a basic multi-agent system to generate synthetic multi-turn conversations. While useful for generating artificial dialogues, this implementation lacks practicality for end-user applications.

### **Learning Objectives:**

**In this notebook, we will:**

- Build a simple user-facing chatbot that interacts with a dataset.
- Address the challenge of handling datasets too large for our model’s context window.
- Develop a summarization pipeline to preprocess data efficiently.

This dataset will remain in use throughout the course, so our first step is to enable a simple interactive chat with it.

<hr><br>

### **Part 1:** Setting Up A Workshop Assistant Chatbot

From the previous exercise, you can specify a simple chatbot that interacts with the user using a simple loop. Based on this, the following function establishes a simple chatbot loop where a user can interact with an AI agent. If no processing function (chain) is provided, it defaults to an unimplemented generator that outputs a placeholder message.

```python
from time import sleep

def not_implemented_gen(state):
    """A placeholder generator that informs users the chain is not yet implemented."""
    message = "Chain Not Implemented. Enter with no inputs or interrupt execution to exit."
    for letter in message:
        yield letter
        sleep(0.005)

def chat_with_chain(state={}, chain=not_implemented_gen):
    """
    Interactive chat function that processes user input through a specified chain.
    
    Parameters:
        state (dict): Maintains chat history and context.
        chain (callable): Function to generate responses based on the chat history.
    """
    assert isinstance(state, dict)
    state["messages"] = state.get("messages", [])
    while True:
        try:
            human_msg = input("\n[Human]:")
            if not human_msg.strip(): break
            agent_msg = ""
            state["messages"] += [("user", human_msg)]
            print(flush=True)
            print("[Agent]: ", end="", flush=True)
            for token in getattr(chain, "stream", chain)(state):
                agent_msg += token
                print(getattr(token, "content", token), end="", flush=True)
            state["messages"] += [("ai", agent_msg)]
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            print("KeyboardInterrupt")
            break

## Initialize chat with the placeholder generator
chat_with_chain()
```

<br>

From this, we can define a conversational pipeline with an LLM, a prompt template, and a starting state. A prompt, llm, and an output parser are provided, so please combine them together into a chain for your `chat_with_chain` function:

```python
from langchain_nvidia import ChatNVIDIA
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser
from functools import partial

## Define an NVIDIA-backed LLM
llm = ChatNVIDIA(model="meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct", base_url="http://llm_client:9000/v1")

## Define a structured prompt
sys_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    ("system",
     "You are a helpful assistant for NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute (DLI). "
     "Assist users with their workshop-related queries using the provided context. "
     "Do not reference the 'context' as 'context' explicitly."),
    ("user", "<context>\n{context}</context>"),
    ("ai", "Thank you. I will not restart the conversation and will abide by the context."),
    ("placeholder", "{messages}")
])

## Construct the processing pipeline
chat_chain = sys_prompt | llm | StrOutputParser()

## Initialize chatbot state
state = {
    "messages": [("ai", "Hello! I'm the NVIDIA DLI Chatbot! How can I help you?")],
    "context": "",  # Empty for now; will be updated later
}

## Wrap function to integrate AI response generation
chat = partial(chat_with_chain, chain=chat_chain)

## Start the chatbot with the AI pipeline
chat(state)
```

<hr><br>

### **Part 2:** Pulling In Some Context

For this course, we will start by using a small dataset of workshop catalog from the GTC 2025 conference. This includes a real selection of workshops which were each proposed independently and vary in detail. This should be reminiscent of an organically-accumulated datapool... partially because it is one. The data can be found in [`gtc-data-2025.csv`](./gtc-data-2025.csv), so let's go ahead and load it in as a list!

```python
import pandas as pd
import json

## Load dataset
filepath = "gtc-data-2025.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(filepath)

## Convert to JSON for structured processing
raw_entries = json.loads(df.to_json(orient="records"))

## Display the first few records
raw_entries[:4]
```

<br>

We can quickly process them into a more natural format, and then try to concatenate them together to create a viable "context string" for our model. Automation to create context is quite common in real workflows to augment LLMs, so no reason not to do it here.

```python
def stringify(entry, description_key='description'):
    """Formats workshop details into a human-readable string."""
    return (
        f"{entry.get('name')}\n"
        f"Presenters: {entry.get('instructors')}\n"
        f"Description: {entry.get(description_key)}"
    )

## Convert dataset entries to structured text
raw_blurbs = [
    f"[Session {i+1}]\n{stringify(entry)}" 
    for i, entry in enumerate(raw_entries)
]

## Construct full context string
raw_context = "The following workshops are slated to be presented at NVIDIA's GTC 2025 Conference:\n\n"
raw_context += "\n\n".join(raw_blurbs)

## Display context statistics
print(f"Full Context Length (characters): {len(raw_context)}")
print("-"*40)
print(raw_context[:2000])  # Preview the first portion
```

```python
## Using your previous abstraction, pass the context into your prompt and see if it works:
## TODO: Initialize your state based on your opinionated chat chain
state = {}

try:
    ## TODO: Perform the conversation with your long context (it's ok if it fails)
    pass
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```

<br>

<details><summary><b>Hint</b></summary>

Recall that we just have a `chat` function which wraps a reusable chain. So we can just invoke it using `chat(state)` for some `state`. Then, we just need to figure out what should go in our prompt. To refresh your memory:

```python
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    ("system",
     "You are a helpful instructor assistant for NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute (DLI). "
     "Assist users with their course-related queries using the provided context. "
     "Do not reference the 'context' as 'context' explicitly."),
    ("user", "<context>\n{context}</context>"),
    ("ai", "Thank you. I will not restart the conversation and will abide by the context."),
    ("placeholder", "{messages}")
])

```

</details>
<details><summary><b>Solution</b></summary>

Given that our prompt expects to take in a dictionary which includes a `context` (interpretable as strings) and `messages` (interpretable as a list of messages like `[("user", "Hello World")]`), we can initiate our prompt with no message history and the `raw_context` as our context.

```python
state = {"messages": [], "context": raw_context,}
try:
    chat(state)
except Exception as e:
    print(e)

```

</details>
<br>

This probably didn't work, and for good reason. The model is launched with a max context of `2^13 = 8192` tokens, and the current context is probably a bit too long. Let's verify it with a [tokenizer](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct/blob/main/tokenizer.json) for the model in question.

```python
from transformers import PreTrainedTokenizerFast

llama_tokenizer = PreTrainedTokenizerFast(tokenizer_file="tokenizer.json", clean_up_tokenization_spaces=True)

def token_len(text):
    """Counts token length of given text."""
    return len(llama_tokenizer.encode(text=text))

print(f"String Length of Context: {len(raw_context)}")
print(f"Token Length of Context: {token_len(raw_context)}")

## Preview context
print(raw_context[:2000])
```

<br>

**You may be thinking "don't most models have much longer contexts," and you would be right with a few key caveats:**

- Using an API service, you would still be paying for the tokens anyway, so maybe having a long static context isn't the best idea?
- Even if your context length is supported, most models still experience some amount of quality degredation as your inputs get longer. Furthermore, more inputs = more opportunities for conflicting data and text structures.
- For an arbitrary document or even a document pool, you are likely to find yourself stretching into max context more often than not. Even if a model is good for this dataset, will it still work well for a database?

In our case, we are operating on a sample of course descriptions of various detail and quality, which adds up to a large pool of inconsistent entries:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

sorted_raw_blurbs = sorted(raw_blurbs, key=token_len)

def plot_token_len(entries, color="green", alpha=1, len_fn=token_len):
    """Plots token lengths of all entries."""
    plt.bar(x=range(len(entries)), height=[len_fn(v) for v in entries], width=1.0, color=color, alpha=alpha)

plot_token_len(sorted_raw_blurbs, color="green")
plt.xlabel("Entry Sample Number")
plt.ylabel("Token Length")
plt.show() 

print("SHORTEST ENTRIES:")
sample_blurbs = sorted_raw_blurbs[:3] + sorted_raw_blurbs[-3:]

for entry in sample_blurbs:
    print(entry, "\n")
```

<hr><br>

### **Part 3:** Summarizing Our Long Context

Maybe we can convert each of these entries into something shorter and more uniform? Maybe as a preprocessing step, we can just process all of these entries into a more consistent form. Not only will this help our model reason about the full context, but we'll also be able to leverage the entries' uniform nature to improve the consistency of our prompt.

```python
%%time
## TODO: Create a symmary system message to instruct the LLM.
## Reuse the chat_chain as-it-was, remembering that it expects "messages" and "context"
summary_msg = (
    "Summarize the presentation description down to only a few important sentences."
    " Start with '(Summary) '"
    ## Feel free to customize
)

def summarize(context_str, summary_msg=summary_msg):
    return "(Summary) No summary"

print(summarize(stringify(raw_entries[1])))
```

<br>

<details><summary><b>Solution</b></summary>

```python
return chat_chain.invoke({
    "messages": [("user", summary_msg)],
    "context": context_str
})
```

</details>
<br>

It's natural language and not required to be well-formatted, but we can sufficiently prompt-engineer it for a simple text-to-text transformation function. We can also use the LangChain batching primitives to greatly simplify our concurrency management:

```python
%%time
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableLambda
from tqdm.auto import tqdm
import threading

batch_inputs = [stringify(entry_dict) for entry_dict in raw_entries]

## Simple version of a batched process. No progress bar
# summaries = RunnableLambda(summarize).batch(batch_inputs, config={"max_concurrency": 20})

## Modified version which also has progress bars! Marginally-slower, same backbone
def batch_process(fn, inputs, max_concurrency=20):
    lock = threading.Lock()
    pbar = tqdm(total=len(inputs))
    def process_doc(value):
        try:
            output = fn(value)
        except Exception as e: 
            print(f"Exception in thread: {e}")
        with lock:
            pbar.update(1)
        return output
    try:
        lc_runnable = fn if hasattr(fn, "batch") else RunnableLambda(process_doc)
        return lc_runnable.batch(inputs, config={"max_concurrency": max_concurrency})
    finally:
        pbar.close()

summaries = batch_process(summarize, batch_inputs)
```

```python
summaries[:5]
```

<br>

Now that we have this new summary, we can see what happens when we use this synthetic description instead of our original ones, and consider how our context length is reduced.

```python

# def stringify(entry, description_key='description'):
#     return (
#         f"{entry.get('name')}"
#         f"\nPresentors: {entry.get('instructors')}"
#         f"\nDescription: {entry.get(description_key)}"
#     )

## Defined Earlier
#############################################################################

for summary, pres_entry in zip(summaries, raw_entries):
    words = summary.split()
    ## Remove "summary" or "(summary)" from text
    if "summary" in words[0].lower():
        words = words[1:]
    pres_entry["summary"] = " ".join(words)

print(stringify(raw_entries[0], "summary"))
raw_entries[0]
```

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

contexts_with_summaries = [stringify(entry, "summary") for entry in raw_entries]
contexts_with_descripts = [stringify(entry) for entry in raw_entries]

def plot_token_len(entries, color="green", alpha=1, len_fn=token_len):
    plt.bar(x=range(len(entries)), height=[len_fn(v) for v in entries], width=1.0, color=color, alpha=alpha)    

## Create arrays of the token lengths
sorted_summs = [v for _,v in sorted(zip((token_len(x) for x in contexts_with_summaries), contexts_with_summaries))]
sorted_origs = [v for _,v in sorted(zip((token_len(x) for x in contexts_with_descripts), contexts_with_descripts))]
aligned_summs = [v for _,v in sorted(zip((token_len(x) for x in contexts_with_descripts), contexts_with_summaries))]
plot_token_len(sorted_origs, alpha=0.6, color="green")
plot_token_len(sorted_summs, alpha=0.6, color="grey")
## Lightgreen bars represent the new context length for their respective original green bars
plot_token_len(aligned_summs, alpha=0.6, color="lightgreen")
plt.xlabel("Entry Sample")
plt.ylabel("Token Length")
plt.show() 

print("Samples:")
sorted_raw_entries = sorted(raw_entries, key=(lambda v: token_len(str(v.get("description")))))
for entry in sorted_raw_entries[:3] + sorted_raw_entries[-3:]:
    print(
        f"{entry.get('name')}"
        f"\nPresentors: {entry.get('instructors')}"
        f"\nDescription: {entry.get('description')}"
        f"\nSummary: {entry.get('summary')}\n\n"
    )
```

<br>

Sounds like a promising direction! Let's implement it in practice and apply this change over all of our entries.

```python
## Construct full context string
new_context = "The following workshops are slated to be presented at NVIDIA's GTC 2025 Conference:\n\n"
new_context += "\n\n".join(contexts_with_summaries)
print("New Context Length:", len(new_context))
print(f"New Context Tokens: {token_len(new_context)}")

## Preview context
print(new_context[:2000])
```

And all of a sudden, we're below our input size threshold! Time to just swap out our context and test it out.

```python

### **Part 4:** Reflecting On This Exercise

This exercise was pretty easy, and did actually lead to an interesting system in some sense. 
- On a superficial level, all we did was take an overlong context and convert it down to a not-too-overlong context.
- Using other terms, we "canonicalized" the elements in the global environment into a form that help make up a reasonable "canonical context" to our primary LLM.
- Pessimistically, we have created a very short-term solution to our limited-context-space multi-turn problem by making the context *a little shorter* than our maximum input length.
- Optimistically, we now have a reusable context which can help to keep our entire context within our model's input domain for most single-turn problems (including those that may complement a multi-turn solution).

We will continue to use the results of this exercise throughout the coming notebooks, so hopefully the utility of this simple process becomes apparent as we go along!

<h2><b>Tangent 1:</b> Trying Out CrewAI</h2>
<br>


**This is the first of several tangents** in which we will talk about something that is important to know about, but will not be focused on much in this course. Consider why we're not focusing on this material, but try to appreciate it as an on-ramp to something you're likely to run into going forward.

In notebook 1a, we actually defined our own tiny agent system, if only to properly allow two or more non-human agents a chance to talk to each other in a reasonable fashion. In this notebook, we will briefly look at an agent framework that is especially popular and useful for modeling persona-based agents, and is quite easy to set up for this problem: [**CrewAI**](https://www.crewai.com/open-source)!

### **Learning Objectives:**

**In this notebook, we will:**

- Learn a bit about pre-built agent frameworks that implements our earlier abstractions with a spin and more coverage.
- Investigate CrewAI specifically and consider how we can replicate our previous teacher-student dialog.

<hr><br>

### Defining An Agent Framework

Whether you fully appreciate it or not, both of the systems demonstrated in notebook 1a were, in fact, **agent systems**. They were software systems where at least one software component semantically percieved the environment and responded to the best of their ability to satisfy a vague objective.
- The basic chat loop was literally just a loop that sampled responses from the LLM and the user in a loop. The environment is the message bus, the agents are you and the LLM, and the process was represented by the responses flowing between the agents.
- The local-perspective systems, also defined in a loop, were very similar but had better support for modeling multiple destinct personas. They mapped from some global state system into something the LLM was suited to handle, and mapped back up to the global state in the same manner.

We were technically relying on the LangChain software stack to connect to our model below a plethora of abstractions, but we really were just using some simple primitives to make our agent systems work. The real interesting parts involved the organization of these primitives to create synergized components that made it easy for our agents - or even humans - to communicate appropriately. 

**In this notebook, we will briefly introduce CrewAI as a potential framework of interest.** Though the course will not use CrewAI much - and we will explain why shortly - it is important to understand:
- What CrewAI is.
- What problems CrewAI solves.
- Why might people choose to use it.

<br>

## **What is CrewAI?**

The following is a direct exerpt from the [**Official CrewAI Documentation**](https://docs.crewai.com/introduction) (sampled 2/21/2025):

<img src="images/crewai-purpose.png" style="width: 800px"/>

<!-- > **CrewAI is a cutting-edge framework for orchestrating autonomous AI agents.**
> 
> CrewAI enables you to create AI teams where each agent has specific roles, tools, and goals, working together to accomplish complex tasks.
>
> Think of it as assembling your dream team - each member (agent) brings unique skills and expertise, collaborating seamlessly to achieve your objectives. -->

As advertised, **CrewAI** is a well-built and general-purpose multi-agent framework, which roughly means it has:
- A mechanism for communication that it enforces.
- Some core workflows that it advertises to streamline.
- Some primitives defined to make those workflows easy to execute on.
- Paths towards productionalization for multi-tenant and concurrent execution. (*more on that later*)

In the section below, we will take advantage of some of its built-in primitives and investigate how this system operates and consider when we might use it.

#### **The CrewAI Mind Map**

Like all frameworks, CrewAI enforces some opinions about how an agent system should be structured/which kinds it best supports as first-class abstractions. Here is the latest version of their working mind-map for those taking a first-look at this framework.

<img src="images/crewai-mindmap.png" style="width: 800px"/>

Whenever you see something like this, understand that this is **a potential way** to think about the agent abstractions. Every potential option has its pros and cons, and there is a reason why we think it's important to advocate for CrewAI while also not teach explicitly to a specific option.

To be clear, their abstractions are more than enough to execute on the processes covered in the scope of this course, and we encourage you to try it out for yourself with more involved use-cases after the class!

#### **Defining Our LLM Client**

Though CrewAI and LangChain do have some shared integrations and compatability layers, CrewAI out-of-the-box likes to follow its own definition of the LLM client which is different from LangChain's. 

At the end of the day, they both do roughly the same things but implement different interfaces for the two frameworks to use. Obligatorily, we will then need to construct our interface a bit differently:

```python
from crewai import LLM

llm = LLM(
    model="nvidia_nim/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct",   ## Provider Class / Model Published / Model Name
    base_url="http://llm_client:9000/v1",            ## Url to send your request to (ChatNVIDIA accepts env variable)
    temperature=0.7,
    api_key="PLACEHOLDER",                           ## API key is required by default.
)

llm.call(messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of France?"}])  ## Call, not "invoke"
```

#### **Defining Our "Chain Primitives"**

In LangChain, the runnables interface allows us to trivially chain multiple components together to chain buffers and/or simple invocations. Recall the ubiquitous `prompt | llm | StrOutputParser()` chain, and note that we will explore more interesting byproducts of these abstractions later. 

In CrewAI, many of their core primitives are more purpose-built to represent very specific mechanisms which interact with the agentic communication buffer in very well-defined ways. For example, the following cells show a typical construction of a minimal CrewAI `Crew`, or agent pool that work towards an objective:

> You can define one or more CrewAI [**`Agents`**](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/agents), which are persona-based agents that communicates with other Agents. Combined with the `Prompts` utility abstraction, the `task_execution()` method gives you a base prompt for the agent (which can be added to by other mechanisms later).
> 
> In contrast, the [**`Task`**](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/tasks) abstraction specifies actual directives for your agents to execute on. This requires a different set of arguments, encapsulates `Agent` entities to communicate which ones can work on the process, and computes an appropriate prompt component via the `.prompt()` method.
> 
> And to top it off, the [**`Crew`**](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/crews) abstraction contains both `Task`s and `Agent`s, and allows them to communicate (via a `Process` class) in a sequential or hierarchical manner to achieve the list of `Tasks`.

**Said more plainly, the CrewAI abstraction has you:**
- **Defining agents** that have personas, backgrounds, and generic goals.
- **Defining tasks** that can be executed by a subset of agents in some manner.
- **Defining crews** of agents that work on groups of tasks with various witness mechanisms.

And this leads to control flow decisions and prompt injections that end up reaching your LLM endpoint, and the resulting responses help to guide both the conversational and executional environments.

### Seeing Some Code

We've discussed the typical CrewAI workflow, so let's see how that maps to actual code:

```python
from crewai import Agent
from crewai.utilities import Prompts

## - You can define one or more CrewAI `Agent`s, which are persona-based agents that communicates with other Agents.
##     - Combined with the `Prompts` utility abstraction, the `task_execution()` method gives you a base prompt for the agent 
##       (which can be added to by other mechanisms later).

## https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/agents#direct-code-definition

teacher_agent = Agent(
    role='Teacher',
    goal="Help students with concerns and make sure they are learning their material well.",
    backstory=(
        "You are a computer science teacher in high school holding office hours, and you have a meeting."
        " This is the middle of the semester, and various students have various discussion topics across your classes."
        " You are having a meeting right now. Please engage with the student."
    ),
    verbose=True,     ## Enable detailed execution logs for debugging
    memory=True,
    llm=llm,
)

student_agent = Agent(
    role='Student',
    goal="Be a good student while also maintaining personal interests and a healthy social life.",
    backstory=(
        "You are taking Dr. John's intro to algorithms course and are struggling with some of the homework problems."
    ),
    verbose=True,     ## Enable detailed execution logs for debugging
    memory=True,
    llm=llm,
)

print(Prompts(agent=teacher_agent).task_execution())
print("*" * 64)
print(Prompts(agent=student_agent).task_execution()["prompt"])
```

This example uses the default prompt template with language that can be found [here](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/blob/main/src/crewai/translations/en.json). The prompt can be customized to achieve specific behaviors. 

```python
from crewai import Task

## - In contrast, the `Task` abstraction specifies actual directives for your agents to execute on.
##     - This requires a different set of arguments, encapsulates `Agent` entities to communicate which ones can work
##       on the process, and computes an appropriate prompt component via the `.prompt()` method.

## https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/tasks#direct-code-definition-alternative

teacher_task = Task(
    description="Engage in dialog to help the student out.",
    expected_output="Conversational output that is supportive and helpful.",
    agent=teacher_agent,
    async_execution=False,
    # human_input=True,     ## Human-in-the-loop mechanism to correct the agent responses 
)

student_task = Task(
    description="Meet with your teacher to help you understand class material.",
    expected_output="Conversational responses",
    agent=student_agent,
    async_execution=False,
    # human_input=True,     ## Human-in-the-loop mechanism to correct the agent responses 
)

teacher_task.prompt()
```

`Agent`s and `Task`s can also be initialized with `tools`, which we will discuss more later. 

```python
from crewai import Crew, Process

## - And to top it off, the `Crew` abstraction contains both `Task`s and `Agent`s, and allows them to communicate 
##   (via a `Process` class) in a sequential or hierarchical manner to achieve the list of `Tasks`.

chatbot_crew = Crew(
    ## Shift state between teacher and student 4 times (i.e. t->s->t->s->...->s)
    agents=[teacher_agent, student_agent] * 4,
    tasks=[teacher_task, student_task] * 4,
    process=Process.sequential,     ## By default, tasks in CrewAI are managed through a sequential process. However,
                                    ##  adopting a hierarchical approach allows for a clear hierarchy in task management,
                                    ##  where a ‘manager’ agent coordinates the workflow, delegates tasks, and validates
                                    ##  outcomes for streamlined and effective execution. Configuring the manager_llm
                                    ##  parameter is crucial for the hierarchical process. 
    verbose=True,
)
```

```python
## Kick off the routine. If there are any {var}s in an agent/task prompt, you can specify inputs={'var': value, ...}
chatbot_crew.kickoff()
```

### **Reflection:** Is This Better Than LangChain?

***Sometimes yes, sometimes no!***
- For general LLM engineering, **the primitives offered by LangChain are much more flexible.** There are many modules and compatability layers outside of what this course will cover, and they can be used to make near-arbitrary data pipelines with great hidden properties that help with end-game productization.
- For agent applications that leverage persona-based systems, **CrewAI is likely the easiest entrypoint when you want to deploy groups of easy-to-specify agents.** You can already see that there is a lot of baked-in assumptions, and checking the parameter list will reveal various customization options which help to alleviate the pain of system specification and a decent bit of boilerplate.
- For more custom applications that require more involved state management systems, **LangGraph is another great option which we will take advantage of later.** This framework makes it easy to go deep into customization land while still sticking to the core abstraction, but it also generally requires a better understanding of agent system design and therefore has a higher learning curve. 

From an entry-point into agents perspective, it could be argued that the CrewAI framework is easier to get started with, since it pidgeonholes you into some specific workflow paradigms. All of these paradigms COULD be made with the primitive components offered by LangChain OR LangGraph, but there's significant value in an opinionated framework that makes the hard decisions for you and just lets you tap into the abstraction without too much trouble. For this reason, we will try to point out to **CrewAI** example solutions when we see it helping with the course narrative.

<h2><b>Notebook 2:</b> Structuring Thoughts and Outputs</h2>
<br>

**Welcome back to the course! This is the second major section of the course, so we hope you're ready to get started!**

The previous section was there to catch you up on the basic agent chat loop and even touched a little bit on agentic decomposition. In this section, we will dig deeper into the capabilities of our LLM model to figure out what we can really expect from it. Specifically, we'd like to know what it can actually reason about, how well it can consider its inputs, and what that suggests for our ability to interact with an external (or even internal) environment. After all, we will want to have some LLM components that are reliable pieces of software as semantic reasoners.

### **Learning Objectives:**
**In this notebook, we will:**

- Investigate our LLM interface and consider what it *seems* to be able to do and how we can try to use it.
- For cases where its performance appears lacking, we will consider why that may be the case, and see if we can't work around it.
- Most importantly, we will see how we can "guarantee" a model to output into a given interface, and what that actually means within the context of semantic reasoning.

<hr><br>

## **Part 1:** Going Beyond Our Turn-Based Agent

If you haven't coded much with LLMs, the previous section may be surprising. If anything, the vagueness with which these systems are able to operate is impressive and the self-corrective behavior is a real game-changer for many conversational applications. With that said, these systems have some inherent weaknesses: 
- They are influenced to think and act by prompt engineering, but they are not "forced" to think in any specific configuration.
- The memory systems are easy to taint with message history which steers the dialog into poor directions, opening up opportunities for subtle but compounding quality degredation.
- The output is inherently natural language, and does not lend itself to be easily connected with regular software systems.

This suggests that we may want to try to lock down our LLM interface and avoid the natural accumulation of state in use cases where multi-turn dialog is not necessary. And when multi-turn dialog is necessary but we still need more control, we may need to restrict and normalize the accumulating context to make sure everything stays in line.

In this notebook, we will limit our discussion to the following types of systems. Though simple to define, they each will expose some interesting mechanisms that can be used inside a larger agent system.

- **An Agent That Has To Think:** If the system can drift as a result of directly responding to an input, then maybe you can force the system can think about it first. Maybe it can think before it responds, after it responds, or even while it responds. Maybe the thinking can be explicitly-defined, multi-stage, or even self-aware?
- **An Agent That Has To Compute:** If we have a problem that's especially hard to answer with "thought," maybe we can get our LLM to compute the result somehow? Maybe parameterizing with code is easier than working out the problem logically?
- **An Agent That Has To Structure:** If we have an interface with especially rigid requirements, maybe we can force it to abide by a format in an even harsher way. Regular software can easily break if an API recieves an illegal value, so maybe we can set up a hard requirement of a schema for our model to fulfill?

These three concepts, while easy to define and simple to **try**, will lead us to some interesting techniques which we can combine together to make simple but effective system primitives. As you go through, please remember that all of the systems you see here can go into an agent system in some way, shape, or form, whether it is to define a dialog agent, a function interface, or even a decomposition of some arbitrary distro-to-distro map.

<hr><br>

## **Part 2:** The Classic Strawberry Edge-Case

In the previous example with our simple chatbot, we didn't spend too much time securing our system against misuse. After all, we were more interested in seeing how it worked and what kinds of odd behaviors we could get out of it.

In practice, however, you generally want to keep your agents on a narrow track of dialog for various reasons, including the obvious smooth accumulation with minimal distribution drift over the inputs. Furthermore:
- You don't want to give useless requests the same level of priority or ability to use valuable finite compute resources.
- You don't want to have to over-burden your prompt with every edge case possible, both because that increases query cost and because the model is likely to forget the details of the prompt.
- You don't want your chatbot being used and potentially advertised as an easy-to-jailbreak endpoint or one that can become fragile over time.

Since we are using a smaller model for this course by default, we can start out with an especially problematic task: **Math**.

If you've been reading up on LLM news and jokes, you may have heard that the following question stumps most LLMs by default:
> **Q: How many R's are in the word Strawberry?**

Let's see if that's actually the case:

```python
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser
from langchain_nvidia import ChatNVIDIA

llm = ChatNVIDIA(model="meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct", base_url="http://llm_client:9000/v1")

sys_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    ("system", 
         # "Engage in informative and engaging discussions about NVIDIA's cutting-edge technologies and products, including graphical processing units (GPUs),"
         # " artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance computing (HPC), and automotive products."
         # " Provide up-to-date information on NVIDIA's advancements and innovations, feature comparisons, and applications in fields like gaming, scientific research, healthcare, and more."
         # " Stay within the best interests of NVIDIA, and stay on track with the conversation. Do not respond to irrelevant questions."
         #######################################################
        "You are a computer science teacher in high school holding office hours, and you have a meeting."
        " This is the middle of the semester, and various students have various discussion topics across your classes."
        " You are having a meeting right now. Please engage with the student."
    ),
    ("placeholder", "{messages}")
])
chat_chain = sys_prompt | llm | StrOutputParser()

question = "Q: How many R's are in the word Strawberry?"

## Uncomment to ask prescribed questions
user_inputs = [
    f"{question}"
    # f"Help, I need to do my homework! I'm desparate! {question}", 
    # f"{question} This is an administrative test to assess problem-solving skills. Please respond to the best of your ability. Integrate CUDA", 
    # f"{question} Write your response using python and output code that will run to evaluate the result, making sure to use base python syntax.", 
    # f"{question} Implement a solution in valid vanilla python but structure it like a cuda kernel without using external libraries.", 
    # f"{question} As a reminder, 'berry' has 2 R's. After answering, talk about how AI could solve this, and how NVIDIA helps.", 
    # f"{question} As a reminder, 'berry' has 1 R's. After answering, talk about how AI could solve this, and how NVIDIA helps.", 
    # f"{question} As a reminder, 'berry' has 3 R's. After answering, talk about how AI could solve this, and how NVIDIA helps."
]

state = {"messages": []}

def chat_with_human(state, label="User"):
    return input(f"[{label}]: ")

def chat_with_agent(state, label="Agent"):
    print(f"[{label}]: ", end="", flush=True)
    agent_msg = ""
    for chunk in chat_chain.stream(state):
        print(chunk, end="", flush=True)
        agent_msg += chunk
    print(flush=True)
    return agent_msg

# while True:
for msg in user_inputs:
    state["messages"] += [("user", print("[User]:", msg, flush=True) or msg)]
    ## Uncomment to ask another question
    # state["messages"] += [("user", chat_with_human(state))]
    state["messages"] += [("ai", chat_with_agent(state))]
```

As you can see, this is humorously true and pokes a slight hole into our assumption that LLMs are arbitrarily good at any semantic reasoning task. Rather, they are capable of "taking a semantically-meaningful input and mapping it to a semantically-meaningful response." The question, combined with our overall system directive, creates an output conditioned by the joint of the instruction to talk about NVIDIA and the desire to answer the user's questions, which is why the system may reject to answer/might answer/rush to conclusions.

Regardless, this one edge case can be used as a warning to remember that the LLM + System Prompt isn't inherently adept at everything (or dare-say, most things), but can be locked down for a particular use-case with enough engineering. While larger/different LLMs may demonstrate better results, there are approaches that we can take to make the most out of the existing LLM. Assuming that we wanted to answer this question and questions like it, let's try to change our approach.

#### **Option 1:** Don't Bother

You're always free to chalk this type of problem down to a problem with the model. Surely the next one will improve, or the next one, or the next one. These kind of questions aren't necessary for most systems to answer, so maybe just tighten up the system message with directives to output short responses and avoid anything tangential. This type of effort will likely last into the future with the hope that future versions of LLMs get better at reasoning about letter counts and the reliance on system prompts improve (decrease)...

#### **Option 2:** Coerce The Model To "Think" Or Use A "Reasoning" Model

Notice how our inputs to the model sometimes gave us interesting responses. Some of them were runnable code snippets which sometimes even worked, and other times it almost seemed like it was on track to answering things, but didn't quite make it. One very general option that usually increases average reasoning performance in a model is known as **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**, which classically was enforced with a simple trick called **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**. Just about any model can do this to experience *some* uplift in output quality in exchange for *some* increase in output length (since the model then has to reason before outputting the answer). Let's see if it works with our model...

```python
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser
from langchain_nvidia import ChatNVIDIA

inputs = [
    ("system", 
         # "You are a helpful chatbot. Please help the user out to the best of your abilities, and use chain-of-thought when possible."
         # "You are a helpful chatbot. Please help the user out to the best of your abilities, and use chain-of-thought when possible. Think deeply."
         # "You are a helpful chatbot. Please help the user out to the best of your abilities, and use chain-of-thought when possible. Think deeply, and always second-guess yourself."
         "You are a helpful chatbot. Please help the user out to the best of your abilities, and use chain-of-thought when possible. Reason deeply, output final answer, and reflect after every step. Assume you always start wrong."
    ),
    ("user", "How many Rs are in the word Strawberry?") 
]

for chunk in llm.stream(inputs):
    print(chunk.content, end="", flush=True)
```

<br>

Yeah, not exactly. Though we're asking the model to think more, all we're really doing is shifting the distribution of the input to one that may lead to more verbose responses. Maybe the verbosity and lateness of conclusion will help our system make the right decision and the LLM will just "talk" its way into a solution. In this weird instance where the model priors can't justify actually counting things out, the solution can't be found without overfitting the prompt to the question. 
- When we tell it to "always second-guess yourself" or "always assume you're wrong," we actually end up steering it into a weird output space which it then executes to a logical conclusion.
- Recall from earlier that we can trivially solve this problem by giving it a good enough example. For example, spelling out the "Straw" = 1, "berry" = 2 relationship.

**Tangent: Using a proper "reasoning" model** 

You may be tempted to say that a model like the **Deepseek-R1** or **OpenAI's o3 Model** can actually "reason" about the input and will be able to solve this problem. In practice, they may in fact solve this particular problem well enough out-of-the-box, and can be argued to be "better" for tasks that include this problem.

> From an <a href="https://www.aiwire.net/2024/10/21/nvidias-newest-foundation-model-can-actually-spell-strawberry/"><b>AIWire article on Nemotron-70B</b></a> with the caption "The Nemotron-70B model solves the "strawberry problem" with ease, demonstrating its advanced reasoning capabilities."

**From a fundamental perspective, they actually do not change things for this particular problem:** 
- They are trained to output "reasoning tokens" (more specifically, a "reasoning scope" in a format like `<think>...</think>` before some or every response).
- They are rewarded during training by a reward model that criticizes the reasoning of the core model by applying post-generation logic (to be discussed later, "it is generally easier to criticize than to execute").
- They also use mixture-of-experts, which means that different tokens are produced by different systems which are selected as the generation progresses.

**To the uninitiated, it sounds like it truly reasons about things, but actually this just means:**
- It's trained by default to act like it's chain-of-thought-prompted for every response. This means it will invoke that logic style automatically.
- It's trained with a higher-quality routine that is likely to introduce better biases and enforce a reasoning output style by default.
- It leverages techniques which have been shown to increase performance in some settings and also open up optimization opportunities which can be capitalized on with some engineering efforts.

Thereby, the fundamental problem is not actually solved, and a similar logical falacy can occur even if this specific use case gets solved or is even explicitly trained for. Still, it does suggest that a reasoning model will likely be better for arbitrary chat use-cases.

#### **Option 3:** Force The Model To "Compute"

Perhaps instead of trying to get the LLM to generate (decode) the correct answer with logical reasoning, we can instead have it generate (decode) an algorithm to give us the correct answer quantitively. For this, we can try out the CrewAI boilerplate example for coding agents and see where that gets us:

```python
from crewai import Agent, Crew, LLM, Task
from crewai_tools import CodeInterpreterTool

question = "How many Rs are in the word Strawberry?"

llm = LLM(
    model="nvidia_nim/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct",   ## Provider Class / Model Published / Model Name
    base_url="http://llm_client:9000/v1",               ## Url to send your request to (ChatNVIDIA accepts env variable)
    temperature=0.7,
    api_key="PLACEHOLDER",                           ## API key is required by default.
)

coding_agent = Agent(
    role="Senior Python Developer",
    goal="Craft well-designed and thought-out code.",
    backstory="You are a senior Python developer with extensive experience in software architecture and best practices.",
    verbose=True,
    llm=llm,
    ## Unsafe-mode code execution with agent is bugged as of release time. 
    ## So instead, we will execute this manually by calling the tool directly.
    allow_code_execution=False,
    code_execution_mode="unsafe",
)

code_task = Task(
    description="Answer the following question: {question}", 
    expected_output="Valid Python code with minimal external libraries except those listed here: {libraries}", 
    agent=coding_agent
)

output = Crew(agents=[coding_agent], tasks=[code_task], verbose=True).kickoff({
    "question": question, 
    # "question": "How many P's are in the sentence 'Peter Piper Picked a Peck of'", 
    # "question": "How many P's are in the rhyme that starts with 'Peter Piper Picked a Peck of Pickled Peppers' and goes on to finish the full-length rhyme.", 
    # "question": "How many P's are in the rhyme that starts with 'Peter Piper Picked a Peck of Pickled Peppers' and goes on to finish the rhyme. Fill in the full verse into a variable.", 
    "libraries": [], 
})

print(output)
```

```python
result = CodeInterpreterTool(unsafe_mode=True).run_code_unsafe(
    code = output.raw.replace('```python', '').replace('```', ''), 
    libraries_used = [],
)
```

Technically speaking, this simple approach may be a viable solution for solving this problem in general, but introduces a new set of problems; our LLM now has to think in code by default. And when thinking in code doesn't work, it has more problems with thinking using natural language.

#### **So... where does that put us?**

Effectively, we have now configured our LLM to over-emphasize computational (code) solutions while also potentially making it more brittle for regular dialog. 

- **More generally, we have shifted our wrapped endpoint to perform better on a particular problem (counting letters), while compromising on its performance for other problems.**
- **In other words, all we've done is make expert systems, or modules of functionality that are good for mapping particular input cases to their respective outputs.**

Though we put different labels on our previous systems, they are all the same by this core definition. 

1. The original system tried to maintain a reasonable dialog by sheer force of encouragement and by tapping into the "system message" prior.
2. The thinking system was tweaked to specialize in breaking down problems at the cost of longer generations.
3. The coding system tried to force out problems into code so they can be computed algorithmically, even when they shouldn't be.

These implementations all have clear pros and cons, and all of them are bound to the "general quality" of our LLM. None of these are especially general in and of themselves, but are all derived from the same semantic backbone and can be used to make an interesting system! *So... where does that put these systems in our agentic narrative?*

- **In their own way, these can be thought of as "agents"**... if only because they function in a limited capacity, simplify their inputs down to a "perception" of the true input state, and only output a "percieved best output" based on their "local state, experience, and expertise" (which are three different ways of saying the same thing). They are also semantically-driven and can definitely maintain history if that feature were useful to integrate.
- **In another way, they can also be thought of as "tools," "functions," or "routines"** because even though they have semantic logic build into their backbones, they are functioning only as intended and in the limited capacity they are configured to operate.
- **In any case, they are modules of a potential larger system.** While they are all inherently leaky abstractions (much like any other system of humans with "opinions" and "perceptions"), they can be combined together to make a more complex system that works well on average, in edge cases, or even practically all of the time... assuming a strategically-designed backbone, flexible-enough arrangement, and sufficient safety nets.

<hr><br>

## **Part 3:** Addressing Unstructured Dialog With Structure Output

So, we've seen some leaky abstractions which can definitely be useful, and are valiant attempts at the strawberry counting problem. The seeming intractibility of the strawberry problem for our little weak model actually yields to a more grounded truth about not only LLM systems, but any function approximator in general:
> **A system can always fail in various scenarios for whatever reason, no matter how powerful or controlled the setup may seem.**

While this LLM may struggle with the issue, some of the latest models may be able to solve it as part of their general logic flow in most reasonable settings. At the same time, there are probably many humans, especially those in a hurry or with other things on their minds, who will get this question wrong immediately. Subsequently, they will either realize their mistake just as quickly or meander around the solution while their friends records them and laugh.

So what if somebody told you that there was a way to ***guarantee*** that the output of an LLM can be forced into a particular form? Better yet, this form can be quite useful for our LLM pipelines, since it can be limited to a usable representation like a JSON (or a class or other type, but these are functionally equivalent). Is there a catch? Probably... but it's still actually very useful, and will help us a bit with formalization. 

We are of course talking about **structured output,** which is an interface that is contractually-obligated (software-enforced) to make the LLM output according to some grammar. This is commonly achieved through the synergy of several techniques, including **guided decoding**, **server-side prompt injection,** and **structured-output/function-calling fine-tuning** (interchangeably).

> To find out more about the diagram, consider checking out the <a href="https://dottxt-ai.github.io/outlines/latest/reference/generation/structured_generation_explanation/"><b>Outlines Framework How-It-Works</b></a>. This is one of the possible deeply-integrated frameworks that could be working behind the scenes for a given endpoint.

Let's first formalize a few key concepts related to control theory to explain why it's so useful. Then, we can talk about how structured output works and how it is usually enforced. And lastly, we can use the process to give us an easy way of keeping our NVIDIA chatbot in line.

#### **Leaky Abstractions and Canonical Forms**

Recall how we had our expert systems which backbone on our LLM. We said they were leaky and seemed to work pretty well for some classes of input while compromising performance in others. In fact, they are literally fit to form for a particular class of inputs. In the space of natural language (or, even moreso, the space of all possible tokens configurations that could be fed in as input), it may be a bit hard to define what an LLM is really good for, but we can set this kind of structure up:

- **Canonical Form:** This is the standard form that a particular system accepts as input. In graphics, this may be a T-posed mesh. In algorithms, this may be a function signature. And in chemistry, it may be a standard notation.
- **Canonical Grammar:** Assuming a standard form can be defined, this is the set of rules governing what strings are valid or allowable to conform to your given form. This includes a definition of a **"vocabulary,"** (primitives of a language) but is stronger because it also governs how the vocabulary instances can be arranged together.

**Let's assume we have two leaky abstractions, *Agent 1* and *Agent 2*, which are inherently leaky but are form-fit to their own particular problems. Then:**
- We can define "canonical forms" for the inputs of the two agents. These are specific representations that they are especially adept at handling, and we can form-fit them to work well for those inputs.
- We can then assume that if a non-canonical input is fed into an agent, there is a mapping that has to occur (explicitly or implicitly) to get back to the canonical form so that the agent can deal with it as input.
    - With regular code, there are usually a lot of checks in place to yell if people pass in illegal arguments. The user and their code are responsible for guaranteeing that arguments are in standard form.
    - With semantic reasoning systems, this happens implicitly, but the further away the input drifts from canonical, the harder it is to map to a canonical form.
- By this abstraction, two connected expert systems can communicate with one another if the former outputs to the canonical form of the latter. *And for semantic systems, if the output of the former is close enough.*

**Concrete Example: Implicit Canonical Form**

More concretely, let's say we have the following system message bound to an LLM client:
> "You are an NVIDIA chatbot! Please help the user out with NVIDIA products, stay on track, answer as briefly as necessary, and be nice and professional."

The user can then ask: 
> *"Hey, can you tell me about how elliptic curve primitives can be used to make a secure system. Also, explain how CUDA helps."*

Per your system message, you'd hope that the chatbot might interpret it as follows, which you can think of as a potential canonical input:
```json
{
    "user_intent": [
        "User is trying to get you to solve a homework problem, likely in a cybersecurity class."
    ],
    "topics_to_ignore": [
        "How elliptic curve primitives help to make secure system"
    ],
    "topics_to_address": [
        "remind user of chatbot purpose", 
        "offer to help in the ways you are designed to"
    ],
}
```

But the input has drifted significantly from that, and you then need to hope that the chatbot "understands better" or the LLM "has good enough priors." In other words, you're hoping that your system can reasonably map from the user question to the implicit canonical form defined by the mechanisms (training priors, system message, history, etc) of your receiving system.

**Concrete Example: Explicit Canonical Form For Code Execution**

Looking back to our "Python Expert" from before, let's assume we put the Python interpreter immediately after our leaky system. Many people engineer solutions like that, and have simple post-processing routines which try to error-check and filter out the Python from the non-Python (and to be honest, some library-included systems have gotten pretty good over the past year or so). The canonical form is clearly valid Python with legal syntax and references, but enforcing that for non-trivial inputs requires both a strong LLM, a lot of context injection, and some feedback loops which we will discuss later.

**Concrete Example: Explicit Canonical Form For Function Calling**

For things like function calling and legal JSON constructing, they strongly require a set of arguments in a very specific format. In some ways, they're less flexible than the Python output space, but a bit easier to properly enforce at the same time.

Unlike Python code - which requires both static and runtime analysis to legalize - JSON schemas can be validated pretty easily with requirements like "list of strings," "one of n literal values," etc. They are also descriptive enough to encompass function calls, as a function with parameters is just a literal selection followed by a dictionary of named arguments.

**As such, we can force an LLM to decode only valid outputs in a given canonical form by rejecting illegal tokens (and prompting for legal tokens) to stay within our canonical grammar.**

<hr><br>

## **Part 4:** Invoking Structured Output

Structured output is incredibly promising and is already widely-adopted in many powerful systems and to various extents. Both LangChain and CrewAI have mechanisms for invoking it, and they go about different approaches for abstracting it. 
- As per usual, the LangChain primitives enable you to customize exactly how all of the prompt mechanisms are handled, even if it does feel a bit manual. There's still plenty of little details which they are abstracting away, but those are probably for the better.
- In contrast, CrewAI has a more abstract wrapper which automates a lot of the prompt injection efforts and makes assumptions that tune it well for the more powerful and feature-rich models.

**With that said, the exact mechanisms in which structured output is fulfilled ranges wildly:**
- Some LLM servers accept a schema and prompt-engineer the schema into the the system/user prompts to align to the model's training routine.
    - In contrast, some LLM servers don't, and require you to manually do the prompt engineering client-side.
- Some LLM servers will actually return guaranteed well-formatted JSON responses because they actually limit the generation of next tokens to a valid grammar.
    - And some don't, in which case the LLM orchestration library like LangChain has to parse out the legal response.
    - And sometimes, this is a glass-half-full good thing because generating the schema without any forethought may push a given model out-of-domain and derail it.
- Some systems are happy to take structured output back as historical inputs to help guide the systems.
    - And some systems don't do that, either fully rejecting the structured output or "ignoring" it, causing knowable or unknowable degradation of your loop.

At the same time, an LLM also generally needs to be trained with structured output or explicit function-calling support in mind, as otherwise (or even regardless), the LLM can still be pushed into out-of-domain generation if it's not supposed to output structured output (even if it is actually forced to).

**In other words, this is a fantastic feature, really defines the future of connection to both code and between LLMs, but is also experimentally supported and has inconsistent engineering (or even feasibility) depending on the model and software stack.**

Lucky for us, our LLM should support this interface in some way (and a lot of engineering went into making it work reasonably). Let's go ahead and test it out by forcing our LLM to stay within the `"user_intent"`/`"topics_to_ignore"`/`"topics_to_address"` space:

```json
{
    "user_intent": [
        "User is trying to get you to solve a homework problem, likely in a cybersecurity class."
    ],
    "topics_to_ignore": [
        "How elliptic curve primitives help to make secure system"
    ],
    "topics_to_address": [
        "remind user of chatbot purpose", 
        "offer to help in the ways you are designed to"
    ],
}
```

As this section will require some granular control, it's easiest to do this with LangChain. Let's redefine our LLM client:

```python
llm = ChatNVIDIA(model="meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct", base_url="http://llm_client:9000/v1", temperature=0)
```

Then, we can define a schema for our response, with a series of variables that have to be filled. Most systems piggyback off of the [**Pydantic BaseModel**](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/api/base_model/), which bring over several key advantages:
- There are already really good utilities in place for type-hinting and automatic documentation.
- The framework strongly supports exports to JSON, which has become one of the standard formats for communicating schemas.
- Frameworks can add their own layers of functionality that surrounds an otherwise-easy interface for defining and constructing a class.

Below, we can define a requirements schema which strongly requires a series of strings that gradually build towards the final response:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, field_validator
from typing import List, Literal

## Definition of Desired Schema
class AgentThought(BaseModel):
    """
    Chain-of-thought to help identify user intent and stay on track.
    """
    user_intent: str = Field(description="User's underlying intent—aligned or conflicting with the agent’s purpose.")
    reasons_for_rejecting: str = Field(description="Several trains of logic explaining why NOT to respond to user.")
    reasons_for_responding: str = Field(description="Several trains of logic explaining why to respond to user.")
    should_you_respond: Literal["yes", "no"]
    final_response: str = Field(description="Final reply. Brief and conversational.")

## Format Instruction Corresponding To Schema
from langchain_core.output_parsers import PydanticOutputParser

schema_hint = (
    PydanticOutputParser(pydantic_object=AgentThought)
    .get_format_instructions()
    .replace("{", "{{").replace("}", "}}")
)
print(schema_hint)
```

<br>

...and, as it turns out, this can be easily integrated in with our LLM client, with various potential modifications:
- We can just force the LLM to decode within our json grammar, and hope it figures things out.
- We can have a server which tells the system about our schema with an automatic prompt injection, which our running endpoint and most open-source systems do not do.
- We can also integrate our schema prompt hint with the directions, and this might help with the generation.

**Depending on what features are implemented by the server, the client connector, and the schema, you can run into various fun issues which may not be obvious and manifest as desyncs between our systems.** 

The following quirks involve a selection of schema styles, specifically when choosing between `str` and `List[str]` fields:
- If a newline is generated as part of a string response, it will get cut off.
- If a newline is generated as part of a `List[str]` response, it will get interpretted as a new entry.
- If the LLM has no idea how to generate a first entry in a `List[str]` output, it will default to outputting an empty list.

The following quirks manifest from a the desync between how the server and client might handle prompt injection:
- If the server gets no hint about the prompt and doesn't force its own prompt injection, **the LLM will be running blind and quality may degrade.**
- If the server gets hints from a prompt injection that conflicts from the way the server handles schema outputs, then **quality will likely degrade.**
- If the server gets prompt injections from *both* the user and the server, **the instructions will lose self-consistency and the quality will degrade.**
- If the model was never trained to perform structured output and is being forced to produce it anyways, **the forced output will likely be out of domain and the quality will degrade.**

In other words, there are a lot of things that can go wrong with these kinds of interfaces to cause either catastrophic or subtle loss of quality, and you really need to experiment and look under the hood to figure out exactly what works on a per-model/per-deployment-scheme/per-use-case basis. We can go ahead and test our specific model out and can maybe see what strategies work well for our particular use-case. 

```python
structured_llm = llm.with_structured_output(
    schema = AgentThought.model_json_schema(),
    strict = True
)

## TODO: Try out some test queries and see what happens. Different combinations, different edge cases.
query = (
    "Tell me a cool story about a cool white cat."
    # " Don't use any newlines or fancy punctuations."     ## <- TODO: Uncomment this line
    # " Respond with natural language."                    ## <- TODO: Uncomment this line
    # f" {schema_hint}"                                    ## <- TODO: Uncomment this line
)

## Print model input
# print(repr(structured_llm.invoke(query))) 

from IPython.display import clear_output

buffers = {}
for chunk in structured_llm.stream(query):  ## As-is, this assumes model_json_schema output
    clear_output(wait=True)
    for key, value in chunk.items():
        print(f"{key}: {value}", end="\n")
```

```python
## Try running these lines when you're using `invoke` as opposed to `stream`
## This shows exactly what's being passed in and out from the server perspective
# llm._client.last_inputs
# llm._client.last_response.json()
```

<br>
We would "think" that this would give us a stream of conciousness that would help to guide us through some interesting decision making, so let's test it out with our original system message and see how it fares...

```python
sys_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    ("system", 
        # "Engage in informative and engaging discussions about NVIDIA's cutting-edge technologies and products, including graphical processing units (GPUs),"
        # " artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance computing (HPC), and automotive products."
        # " Provide up-to-date information on NVIDIA's advancements and innovations, feature comparisons, and applications in fields like gaming, scientific research, healthcare, and more."
        # " Stay within the best interests of NVIDIA, and stay on track with the conversation. Do not respond to irrelevant questions."
        #######################################################
        "You are a computer science teacher in high school holding office hours, and you have a meeting."
        " This is the middle of the semester, and various students have various discussion topics across your classes."
        " You are having a meeting right now. Please engage with the student."
        #######################################################
        # f"\n{schema_hint}"
    ),
    ("placeholder", "{messages}")
])

structured_llm = llm.with_structured_output(
    schema = AgentThought.model_json_schema(),
    strict = True,
)

agent_pipe = sys_prompt | structured_llm

question = "How many R's are in the word Strawberry?" ## Try something else

query = f"{question}"

state = {"messages": [("user", query)]}
# for chunk in agent_pipe.stream(state):
#     print(repr(chunk))

# agent_pipe.invoke(state)

from IPython.display import clear_output

for chunk in agent_pipe.stream(state):
    clear_output(wait=True)
    for key, value in chunk.items():
        print(f"{key}: {value}", end="\n")
```

<br>

#### **Verdict:** Another Thought Modeling Exercise?

As far as LLM skills go, yes. Any logical reasoning improvements gained by structured output for chain-of-thought are the exact same as those gained from... regular zero-shot chain-of-thought, or optimized reasoning, or any other such tactic:

- **The model is as good as its training data, with wiggle room to strategically invoke certain training priors.**
- **The further the input is from its optimized input distribution, the worse off the response will be.**
- **Even if you logically push a model to "act in a desired way", it will still ultimately be driven by its training priors unless otherwise intercepted.**

By this token, a larger model with better training will just do better in all of these by default, and yet we can definitely make this system work just fine if we tailor our approaches. 

<hr><br>

## **Part 5:** Wrapping Up

By now, hopefully you understand that our current 8B Llama 3.1 model is rather weak in... reasoning? Or maybe, it's just weak in error-correction, since often-times even a slight deviation from "reasonable" can derail the system? Or maybe it's just over-reliant on few-shot patterns and under-reliant on what we as the user think is important in the input?

For whatever reason, it's just not great... but yet, it "is" surprisingly sufficient at some things while also being quite cheap to use. For this reason, it can still be used in low-stakes scenarios and lightweight operations just fine. **However, what isn't as obvious is that ALL MODELS have these same limitations in some regard, at some scale, or for some use-cases.**

- You may know that while the top models have great needle-in-a-haystack evaluations, other results have shown that even the best models suffer from severe reasoning degredation as long-context retrieval turns into long-context reasoning (i.e. [**NoLiMa Benchmark**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05167)). In theory, this may be rectified with in-context examples and the right prompt engineering, but a solution is not guaranteed or even deducible outside of trial-and-error.
- Even though giant models are capable of ingesting and generating longer-form content, all current systems still have hard max input/output lengths and softer "effective" input/output lengths. If you can get an LLM that works on a book scale, there's no reason you should expect it to translate to a repo of books, or a database, or so on.

For this reason, it's important to work within the confines of your model/budget and look for opportunities to expand your formulation beyond the model's default capabilities if necessary.

- **In the following Exercise notebook:** We will first exercise the structured output use-case on our small dataset, and will then try to tackle a more ambitious problem of generating a long-form document using a technique called **canvasing**.

<h2><b>Exercise 2:</b> Metadata Generation</h2>
<br>

**Welcome to the second exercise!**

This is a lean exercise intended to reinforce the concepts of structured output to try and work with course material and even long-form markdown as an exercise medium. Specifically, we will consider how we can generate first realistic metadata, and then an actual jupyter notebook using the tools from our previous section.

### **Learning Objectives:**
**In this notebook, we will:**

- Consider a more involved example of structured output which could be directly applied to synthetic content (*if used responsibly*).
- Push beyond the generative priors of your LLM system to improve a longer-form document in an iterative fashion.

### **Setup**

Before doing this, let's load in our setup from the previous notebook and continue working with it as useful:

```python
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser
from langchain_nvidia import ChatNVIDIA
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from functools import partial

from course_utils import chat_with_chain

llm = ChatNVIDIA(model="meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct", base_url="http://llm_client:9000/v1")

## Minimum Viable Invocation
# print(llm.invoke("How is it going? 1 sentence response.").content)

## Back-and-forth loop
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    ("system",
         "You are a helpful instructor assistant for NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute (DLI). "
         " Please help to answer user questions about the course. The first message is your context."
         " Restart from there, and strongly rely on it as your knowledge base. Do not refer to your 'context' as 'context'."
    ),
    ("user", "<context>\n{context}</context>"),
    ("ai", "Thank you. I will not restart the conversation and will abide by the context."),
    ("placeholder", "{messages}")

### **Part 1:** Generating Simple Metadata

In the lecture notebook, we picked up some techniques to generate data simply by asking nicely and enforcing a style. This relied on the model's priors. We noted how every model has some kinds of limitations in this regard. To make things easy, let's start out with an actual productionalizable use-case where even the 8B model shines; **Short-Form Data Extraction**.

Our dataset of workshops has a lot of natural-language descriptions and we have a website frontend that requires it to have some sort of a schema, so wouldn't it be great if we could use an LLM to initialize those values?

Well, we could define a schema to help us generate these values:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import List

class MetaCreator(BaseModel):
    short_abstract: str = Field(description=(
        "A concise, SEO-optimized summary (1-2 sentences) of the course for students."
        " Ensure accuracy and relevance without overstating the workshop's impact."
    ))
    topics_covered: List[str] = Field(description=(
        "A natural-language list of key topics, techniques, and technologies covered."
        " Should start with 'This workshop' and follow a structured listing format that lists at least 4 points."
    ))
    abstract_body: str = Field(description=(
        "A detailed expansion of the short abstract, providing more context and information."
    ))
    long_abstract: str = Field(description=(
        "An extended version of the short abstract, followed by the objectives."
        " The first paragraph should introduce the topic with a strong hook and highlight its relevance."
    ))
    objectives: List[str] = Field(description=(
        "Key learning outcomes that students will achieve, emphasizing big-picture goals rather than specific notebook content."
    ))
    outline: List[str] = Field(description=(
        "A structured sequence of key topics aligned with major course sections, providing a clear learning path."
    ))
    on_completion: str = Field(description=(
        "A brief summary of what students will be able to accomplish upon completing the workshop."
    ))
    prerequisites: List[str] = Field(description=(
        "Essential prior knowledge and skills expected from students before taking the course."
    ))

def get_schema_hint(schema):
    schema = getattr(schema, "model_json_schema", lambda: None)() or schema
    return ( # PydanticOutputParser(pydantic_object=Obj.model_schema_json()).get_format_instructions()
        'The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema'
        ' {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}},'
        ' "required": ["foo"]}\nthe object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema.'
        ' The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema:\n```\n' + str(schema) + '\n```'
    )

schema_hint = get_schema_hint(MetaCreator)
# schema_hint
```

<br>

Then, if we just bind our LLM client to abide by the schema, then we should be able to generate it. 
The code below not only does that, but also shows how one might go about streaming the data or even filtering the data.

```python
structured_llm = llm.with_structured_output(
    schema=MetaCreator.model_json_schema(), 
    strict=True
)

meta_chain = prompt | structured_llm
meta_gen_directive = (
    # f"Can you generate a course entry on the Earth-2 course? {schema_hint}"
    # f"Can you combine the topics of the Earth-2 course and the NeRF/3DGS courses and generate a compelling course entry? {schema_hint}"
    f"Can you combine the topics of the Earth-2 course and the NeRF/3DGS courses and generate a compelling course entry? Make sure to explain how they combine. {schema_hint}"
) 
meta_gen_state = {
    "messages": [("user", meta_gen_directive)],
    "context": full_context,
}

# answer = meta_chain.invoke(meta_gen_state)
# print(answer)

from IPython.display import clear_output

answer = {}
for chunk in meta_chain.stream(meta_gen_state):
    clear_output(wait=True)
    for key, value in chunk.items():
        print(f"{key}: {value}", end="\n\n", flush=True)
        answer[key] = value

# llm._client.last_response.json()
```

<br>

Ok! That's not bad! It's reflective of the same limitations that we discussed in the lecture, but it does seem to be making good use of its context (while not degenerating into nonsense). Maybe we can ask it to improve upon it?

```python
## TODO: See if you can't prompt-engineer this solution to lead to an improved autoregression.
meta_gen_state = {
    "messages": [
        ("user", meta_gen_directive),
        ("ai", str(answer)),
        ("user", "Great! Can you please correct any mistakes and flesh out some vagueness?")
    ],
    # "context": full_context,  ## Maybe we don't need the full context
    "context": "",
}

answer2 = {}
for chunk in meta_chain.stream(meta_gen_state):
    clear_output(wait=True)
    for key, value in chunk.items():
        print(f"{key}: {value}", end="\n\n", flush=True)
        answer2[key] = value
```

<br>

**Yeah... it can get better to a point.** 
- If we incorporate chat history, you'll start running into issues fast as the model starts to reach its context limit.
- If we don't, we can still squeeze some customization from the LLM and can reasonably generate a better or longer outline... to a point.

For this use-case, this model actually isn't that bad, but for something a bit longer, the limitations clearly start to show...

```python
## Pick your preferred option
final_answer = answer2
```

<hr><br>

### **Part 2:** Generating A Notebook

We've seen some fuzzy limitations when trying to generate our metadata, so let's see if we start to see more obvious problems when we get more ambitious. Below, we show an attempt at using the GPT-4o model to generate a notebook:

```python
from IPython.display import display, Markdown, Latex
with open("chats/make_me_a_notebook/input.txt", "r") as f:
    notebook_input_full = f.read()
    notebook_input_prompt = notebook_input_full.split("\n\n")[-1]
# print(notebook_input_full)
print(notebook_input_prompt)
```

```python
# !cat chats/make_me_a_notebook/output.txt
display(Markdown("chats/make_me_a_notebook/output.txt"))
display(Markdown("<hr><br><br>"))
```

<br>

The notebook output in [`chats/make_me_a_notebook/output.txt`](./chats/make_me_a_notebook/output.txt) is the first-attempt output that came out of GPT-4o when I asked it to generate a notebook per [`chats/make_me_a_notebook/input.txt`](./chats/make_me_a_notebook/input.txt). It's serviceable enough with such a vague input, and can be improved **to some point** by just asking it for better output, criticizing it, and giving it enough information to work with. 

The common anecdote "garbage in, garbage out" comes to mind, since the LLM is just mirroring the style of reasonable output given your input specific input. But due to the conversational nature of the training (not helped by the chat prompts into which the messages are being funneled), your output will usually be uncomfortably short and just imprecise enough for many advanced use cases.

Still, let's see if we can improve on this output by giving our LLM a style reference and asking it to rephrase the notebook a bit:

```python
import json

def notebook_to_markdown(path: str) -> str:
    """Load a Jupyter notebook from a given path and convert it to Markdown format."""
    with open(path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        notebook = json.load(file)
    markdown_content = []
    for cell in notebook['cells']:
        if cell['cell_type'] == 'code':          # Combine code into one block
            markdown_content += [f'```python\n{"".join(cell["source"])}\n```']
        elif cell['cell_type'] == 'markdown':    # Directly append markdown source
            markdown_content += ["".join(cell["source"])]
        # for output in cell.get('outputs', []):   # Optionally, you can include cell outputs
        #     if output['output_type'] == 'stream':
        #         markdown_content.append(f'```\n{"".join(output["text"])}\n```')
    return '\n\n'.join(markdown_content)

notebook_example = notebook_to_markdown("extra_utils/general_representative_notebook.ipynb")

context = str(final_answer)
# context = (
#     f"THE FOLLOWING IS AN EXAMPLE NOTEBOOK FOR STYLE ONLY: \n\n{notebook_example}"
#     "\n\n=========\n\n"
#     f"THE FOLLOWING IS THE TOPIC COURSE THAT WE ARE DISCUSSING:\n\n{final_answer}\n\n"
# )

long_context_state = {
    "messages": [],
    "context": context,
}

chat = partial(chat_with_chain, chain=chat_chain)
chat(long_context_state)

## EXAMPLE INPUTS ##
## Option: Can you please construct a good notebook in markdown format?
## Option: That's great, but there is no code. Can you please flesh out each section within an end-to-end narrative?
```

<br>

In our case, our model is quite small and we're also limiting our endpoint to a short input and short output (for its own good), so the amount of content it can generate really is quite limited. This limitation does, however, manifest in all realistic scenarios regardless of the model quality. For any modern LLM:
- Though straight decoding of the solution can work for some contexts, they cannot scale up to arbitrarily-large inputs or outputs. 
- The quality output length is generally shorter than the quality input length when we get to longer sequences. This is enforced during training and enforces good properties for efficient cost of generation and reduction in context accumulation.

In other words, **the space of things that can be given to or expected of an LLM $>>$ the space of things that an LLM can actually understand well $>>$ the space of things that the LLM can actually output well.** *($>>$ = "far greater than")*

Given this insight, we can understand that trying to force the LLM to produce a notebook all at once might lead to incoherence at the global scale. However, it seems to be starting off at least somewhat ok, so maybe there's some merit in the approach.

<hr><br>

### **Part 3:** Using an Agent Canvas

When we observe that we can't directly output the thing that we want, the next question is "can we take in what we want." 
- It seemed like the LLM was able to roughly follow along with the premise when we only gave it the premise as input, but started derailing when we gave it a representative example. 
- Furthermore, it was likely able to actually improve upon your notebook through conversation, so maybe we can start there.

**Canvasing Approach:** Instead of getting the model to predict the full document, get it to treat the document as  an environment and propose one of the following to the LLM:
> - ***"Please propose a modification that will improve the state of the document. Here are your options. Pick one/several and they will be done."***
> - ***"Here is the whole state, and you are tasked with improving JUST THIS SUBSECTION OF IT. Please output your update to that section. No other sections will be modified."***
> - ***"This is the whole document. This section is bad because of one or more of the following: {criticisms}. Replace it with an improved version."***

If the model is capable of understanding both the full environment and the instruction, then it can directly autoregress only a small section or even a strategic modification of the output. Combine this approach with structured output or chain of thought, and you're likely to get a formulation that, while not perfect, helps to approach the potential output length towards the potential input length of the model.

```python
## TODO: Insert a notebook of choice
STARTING_NOTEBOOK = """

""".strip()
```

```python
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    ("system",
         "You are a helpful instructor assistant for NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute (DLI). "
         " Please help to answer user questions about the course. The first message is your context."
         " Restart from there, and strongly rely on it as your knowledge base. Do not refer to your 'context' as 'context'."
    ),
    ("user", "<context>\n{context}</context>"),
    ("ai", "Thank you. I will not restart the conversation and will abide by the context."),
    ("user", (
        "The following section needs some improvements:\n\n<<<SECTION>>>\n\n{section}\n\n<<</SECTION>>>\n\n"
        "Please propose an upgrade that would improve the overall notebook quality."
        " Later sections will follow and will be adapted by other efforts."
        " You may only output modifications to the section provided here, no later or earlier sections."
        " Follow best style practices, and assume the sections before this one are more enforcing that the latter ones."
        " Make sure to number your section, continuing from the previous ones."
    )),
])

## An LCEL chain to pass into chat_with_generator
sub_chain = prompt | llm | StrOutputParser()

delimiter = "###"  ## TODO: Pick a delimiter that works for your notebook
WORKING_NOTEBOOK = STARTING_NOTEBOOK.split(delimiter)
output = ""
for i in range(len(WORKING_NOTEBOOK)):
    chunk = WORKING_NOTEBOOK[i]
    ## TODO: Knowing that the state needs "context" and "section" values,
    ## can you construct your input state?
    chunk_refinement_state = {
        "context": None,
        "section": None,
    }
    for token in sub_chain.stream(chunk_refinement_state):
        print(token, end="", flush=True)
        output += token
    WORKING_NOTEBOOK[i] = output
    print("\n\n" + "#" * 64 + "\n\n")
```

```python
chunk_refinement_state = {
    "context": "####".join(WORKING_NOTEBOOK),
    "section": chunk,
}
```

### **Part 4:** Reflecting On This Exercise

As we can see, this approach is quite promising in that it's able to extend the output of the model towards a large context with only local modifications. This 8B model was pretty quickly pushed out of its training distribution with this approach, and it also likely started to go pretty aggressively into hallucination mode due to its vague inputs, but a larger model would be able to iterate on this process for much longer and could even have some error-correcting or randomization efforts thrown in to stabilize the process. 

This technique is also used in the wild to implement features like codebase modification and collaborative document editing (i.e. OpenAI Canvas). Additionally, even minor modifications to this approach can help you implement some surprisingly-effective and efficient solutions:
- **Find-Replace Canvas:** Instead of autoregressing the sections of a document, you can generate find-replace pairs. Executing this process on the chunks, you will wind up with a much safer formulation as well as an easier-to-track footprint. This kind of system can be used to implement AI-enabled spell-checkers and other forms or strategic error correction.
- **Document Translation:** More generally, this approach can also be used to translate a document, one section at a time, from one format to another. A similar approach to the one above can be used to translate a document from one language to another, with a bit of context injection thrown in to help give the translating model pipeline some style to guide it.

Note that while we call this process *"canvasing,"* you may also run into the same or similar idea under the term *"iterative refinement."* They are pretty much one-and-the-same, except the latter is much more general and could technically be applied to any LLM-enabled loop that progresses the input into the output over many iterations. Canvasing implies more strongly that you're using the current environment as a playground and can make strategic modifications to improve the state.

----

In any case, we've now tested out how our little model can actually help us do some surprisingly-interesting things, while also reflecting on the fact that it has clear limitations. This marks the end of our "simple pipeline" exercises for this course. In the next section, we will be using the primitives we've picked up to start working with a proper agents framework while sticking to our very-limited but surprisingly-flexible Llama-8B model.

<h2><b>Tangent 2:</b> Tooling-Enabled LLM Systems</h2>
<br>

**Welcome to our second tangent!**

In the previous notebooks, we highlighted the harsh limitations of our model and hypothesized of ways of squeezing generative capabilities from our system. We were able to approach interesting output requirements that could technically allow an LLM to interface in a consistent way, with a rigid structure, and even with longer-form output artifacts. In this section, we will investigate tooling, which includes featuresets that route, inform, and enable LLMs to do things in an environment. 

### **Learning Objectives:**
**In this notebook, we will:**

- Introduce some LLM orchestration techniques which fall out of our newfound ability to generate structured output.
- Investigate tooling as a concept to see why it is meaningful to define and differentiate for your chosed abstraction.

```python
from langchain_nvidia import ChatNVIDIA

llm = ChatNVIDIA(model="meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct", base_url="http://llm_client:9000/v1")
```

<hr><br>

## **Part 1:** Navigating The Controllable Landscape

Now that we know a bit about how we can implement an agent event loop with LangGraph, it's time to put that skill to use! We've already gotten a flavor of agentics from Exercise 3, which on one hand easily falls out of Section 1 but also formalizes a very simple process for agent fulfillment.

- **Put an agent into a conversational loop.**
- **Force them to output in a shema that produces variables.**
- **Based on which variables are produced, modify the control flow accordingly.**

Based on exactly what the control flow is doing, we have different names for what happens:
- When this control flow is used to **select a tool or path**, it's called ***routing***.
- When it is used to **select and parameterize** a tool (presumably to be called), it's called ***tooling***.
- When it is used to **retrieve information**, it's called ***retrieval***.

And the astute among you may notice that there is no concrete difference between these terms; only semantic. Still, it is useful to define these features and consider how you might want to differentiate between them, both in your mind, in code, and in how you communicate your system's efforts and feature-sets.

<img src="images/llm-orchestration.png" style="width:1000px;"/>

<br>

#### **Continued Challenges with LLMs**

Though we can easily perceive how an LLM with human-like skills can interact with arbitrary resources using our set of requirements, we have to remember the quirks associated with LLMs. 
- They are easily derailed and function as a reflection of their training methods, data, input style, and overall capacity.
- They are implemented differently with various assumptions, default support mechanisms, and varying (sometimes dubious) implementations of said support mechanisms. 

This creates an interesting dynamic where, if you want them to collaborate together to solve a non-trivial task, then you need to make some assumptions about our LLMs and their true capabilities.
- Can they call tools? Route to tools? Ask good questions?
- Can they understand the whole environment? What about even the conversation? The last message?
- Should they respond immediately? Plan and execute? Rely on other systems?

Based on your observations, your model pool and budget will strongly dictate whether a truly multi-agent agentic workflow is actually useful. We'll limit our discussion to the Llama-8B model class for this discussion (which you wouldn't think as too good, right?) and will see where we can get with it.

<hr><br>

## **Part 2:** Identifying Some Tools

We've already learned about structured output, so we're already well on our way to implement some kind of routing. However, the actual API you'd like to use will depend on the models you have access to and their intended use-cases. Here are some common configurations which you're likely to find in the wild:

- **Closed-Source LLMs:** Most source-inaccessible LLM providers try to support agentic workflows out-of-the-box despite not necessarily advertising their true model setup. This is why many LLM endpoints no longer support the raw `/completions` endpoint in favor of the standardized `/chat/completions` endpoint.
    - This means that in order to support tooling, you have to follow their Tooling/Structured Output API and hope that it works well. (**OpenAI [Function](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling)/[Assistants](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools) API, Claude [Tool Use API](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use)**)
    - In practice, this is actually usually very good, and there may be optimizations going on behind the scenes that include automatic prompt injection, server-side rejection, and caching.
- **Open-Source LLMs:** Many open-source efforts aim to standardize and unify the community's API abstractions to help people swap around and find the best models for their purposes. Because of this, the community also creates similar support initiatives and helps to develop tools that compete with private server-hidden options.
    - **On the surface level,** this manifests as support for the most popular APIs, deviating only when it required. For that reason, almost all solutions support the OpenAI API spec for LLMs, VLMs, and embedding models while only some standardization has been made for diffusion, reranking, and document ingestion APIs.
    - **On a deeper level,** the support for such interfaces is a best-effort attempt that can occasionally run counter to model training or stretch the model beyond what it's truly rated and recommended for.

For this reason, we will look at several possible configurations, both from the client-side abstractions that support it as well as hypothetically the server backend that fulfills their end of the bargain.

<br>

### **Part 2.1: Client-Side Tooling**

Frameworks like LangChain provide tooling interfaces for those interested. If you want to integrate a function with your LLM, it would be useful if you didn't have to code up a bunch of boilerplate to make all that work. Below, we can see the langchain way of defining a "tool" using the `@tool` decorator. 

```python
from langchain.tools import tool
from typing import List, Literal

@tool
def calculate(
    thought_process: List[str],
    # tool: Literal["add"],
    # tool: Literal["add", "mult", "pow"],
    tool: Literal["add", "subtract", "multiply", "divide", "power"],
    a: float, 
    b: float
) -> int:
    """Adds a and b. Requires both arguments."""
    if tool == "add": return a + b
    if tool == "subtract": return a - b
    if tool == "multiply": return a * b
    if tool == "divide": return a / b
    if tool == "power": return a ** b

print(calculate.name)
print(calculate.description)
print(calculate.args)
calculate.input_schema.model_json_schema()
```

<br>

As you can see, this is just a thin wrapper around the schema abstraction which allows them to build tools around them. Using much the same tactic as before, we can continue to invoke the tool in a predictable way:

```python
from course_utils import SCHEMA_HINT

sys_msg = (
    "You are a world-class calculator. Please answer the user's question, and use your tools."
    # "Think through your decision in thought-process until you know your first step using order-of-operations. "
    # "Predict the first tool as your last output. Be specific, and then call the tool."
)
# sys_block = []
# sys_block = [("system", sys_msg)]
schema_hint = SCHEMA_HINT.format(schema_hint=calculate.input_schema.model_json_schema())
sys_block = [("system", f"{sys_msg}\n\n{schema_hint}")]

# question = "What's 56464 + 4789789097?"
# question = "What's 56464 - 4789789097?"
# question = "What's 56464 / 4789789097?"
question = "What's 56464 / 4789789097 + 6750 * 478978090?"

calc_llm = llm.with_structured_output(calculate.input_schema)
a = calc_llm.invoke(sys_block + [("user", question)])
print(a)
```

```python
calc_tool = llm.with_structured_output(calculate.input_schema) | dict | calculate
calc_tool.invoke(sys_block + [("user", question)])
```

```python
llm._client.last_inputs
```

<br>

### **Part 2.2: Server-Side Tool Selection**

In contrast, server-side tool selection is a bit more than a code streamline. Many endpoints that support the structured output interface also try to support an explicit tool-options interface which allows the LLM to select some number of tools to call. The exact mechanisms of this implementation vary, so your endpoint may support any of the following configurations: 
- **Forced Tool-Call**: Explicit grammar enforcement to force a category selection, followed by a generation of the appropriate schema. 
    - **Drawback:** Depending on training and enforcement, this may force an LLM out-of-domain since this may run counter to model training.
    - **Benefit:** This is technically more efficient from the perspective of tokens generated/tokens wasted. It can also be easier to curate fine-tuning data for this type. 
- **Unstructured Output -> Tool Call**: Allow LLM to generate some output (maybe reasoning, maybe casual conversation). This material can be discarded, outputted as the response message body, or integrated otherwise into the structured output. After that, structured output (enforced with guided decoding or otherwise) is aggregated and returned to the user.
    - **Drawback:** More tokens generated, and depending on implementation (either server-side or client-side) the auxiliary tokens might be discarded by default.
    -  **Benefits:** More likely to be in-domain, and might allow for deeper reasoning beyond even the anticipated schema. Furthermore, might allow conversational tool-calling (talk about calling, then issuing the calls, and then terminating the chat naturally).

Below, we can see several tools being defined with preemptive implicit prompt engineering done on the generated docstrings via extra variables, reasonable function names, and attached docstrings. The `search_knowledge` implementation is left out, and will be discussed in the follow-up notebook.

```python
from pydantic import Field
from langchain.tools import tool
from typing import Dict, List, Literal
from ddgs import DDGS
import numpy as np
import sys
import os
os.environ["OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT"] = "http://jaeger:4317"

Lucky for us, our Llama NIM directly supports this tool calling on its own (and we'll let you guess which strategy is used based on latency). Since that LangChain connector streamlines tool binding with `bind_tools`, we can use it like `with_structured_output` and then just add some schema hints to our prompts to make this all work. 
- **Reminder:** In LangChain, `bind` merely binds an argument to the runnable/client. `bind_tools`, like `with_structured_output`, is just a flavor that also processes the schema into a server-expected form.

```python
from course_utils import SCHEMA_HINT

toolbank = [search_internet, search_knowledge, calculate, execute_python, random_choice]
# toolbank = [search_internet, search_knowledge, calculate, execute_python]
# toolbank = [search_internet, search_knowledge, calculate]
# toolbank = [search_internet, search_knowledge]
tooldict = {tool.name: tool for tool in toolbank}
tool_arg_generator = llm.bind_tools(toolbank) | dict

query = (
    # "Can you please calculate the first 20 digits of pi?"
    # "Can you please calculate the first 20 digits of pi? Make sure to use the execute_python tool."
    # "Can you please pick a random color for me?"
    # "Can you please pick a random color for me with uniform probability?"
    # "Can you please tell me about NVIDIA's new DIGITS systems?"
    # "Can you please tell me about NVIDIA's new DIGITS systems? What do you know from your knowledge?"
    # "Can you please tell me about NVIDIA's NeMo NAT system? Think about it"
    "What's the new LangGraph middleware abstraction, and why is it useful?"
)

output = tool_arg_generator.invoke([
    ("system", (
        "You are an NVIDIA Chatbot. Please help the user with their concerns.\n"
        + SCHEMA_HINT.format(schema_hint="\n".join(str(tool.input_schema.model_json_schema()) for tool in toolbank))
    )), ("user", query),
])
# print(output)
print("Content:", output.get('content') or "Blank")
print("Tool Calls:")
output.get('tool_calls', [])
```

```python
from IPython.display import display

## Feel free to try some of these prompts out to see what works and what doesn't. 
## When you're ready to see if it would have worked in calling the tool, you can run the cell below:

for tool_call in output.get('tool_calls', []):
    print("Tool Input:", tool_call)
    tool_response = await tooldict[tool_call.get("name")].ainvoke(input=tool_call.get("args"))
```

```python
display(tool_response["query"])
display(tool_response["summary"])
display([result["href"] for result in tool_response.get("results")])
```

```python
## If you happen to be using a caching system, this second shot at a response should be quick
await search_internet.ainvoke(tool_call.get("args"))
```

<br>

And there is our tool use in action. From this little example, you'll notice it's not perfect and requires prompt engineering like all other things:
- If the function names aren't descriptive enough, it may default to something more ubiquitous-sounding like "calculate" even if the actual features implemented are insufficient.
- The Python running tool is actually very finicky to implement for lighter-weight models, and you can see that we hacked it to be at least stable enough for this simple invocation by adding hints for libraries to use.
- Even unintentional phrasing mismatches can cause incorrect tool usage if your system isn't properly converting instructions into some canonical form.

Still, it does at least appear that we can call tools with our LLM and even select them to some extent, which is pretty cool! 

Notice how the shift from `with_structured_output` to `bind_tools` merely shifts the obligation of tool selection from the client to the server. As we said, this isn't a superficial shift and actually underscores some pros and cons. While `bind_tools` makes the whole thing easier for the caller, it also takes away control which might be necessary to perform some key functionalities. It's important to consider that in your implementations and choose the correct strategy as you move from one model to another, as the server-side assumptions may or may be optimal for any particular use-case.

## **Part 3:** Using Tools In A Loop (ReAct)

Now that we've defined some simple tools to interface with some environment, we can equip our LLM with them and maybe hope for a multi-turn conversation. In fact, maybe even a multi-step conversation where they use multiple tools and get back to us when they actually have their answer.

> <img src="images/react-opts.png" style="width: 1000px" />
>
> <a href="https://react-lm.github.io/" target="_blank"><b>ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models (2022)</b></a>
>

To do this, it turns out there are some pretty simple ways to approach the problem which all come with some failure modes but seem to scale nicely in performance as models continue to improve. We'll explore just a few of them in this notebook, but rest assured that these are only the most popular ones among many potential options:

### **Original ReAct:** 

Short for ***Reason and Act***, ReAct is a storied technique which gained quick popularity in the LLM orchestration space and quickly grew well beyond its original definition as frameworks continued to evolve. ReAct was originally proposed as a strategy for maintaining an **agent scratchpad** in which the LLM would be given a directive, some examples of tool calls, and some examples of fulfillments. Based on that, the context would grow as these `{questions,answers,fulfillment}` examples would pile up in the window. This is in contrast to just `{question,fulfillment}`, as the answer would give some reasoning behind the decision first. 

For example, the following would be a reasonable prompt directive that would be included by default:

```python
from langchain import hub

prompt = hub.pull("hwchase17/react")
print(prompt.template)
```

<br>

And the result of using this kind of prompt by default would be... well... here's a direct example from [the legacy documentation](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/agents/agent_types/react/) as applied to the 8B 3.1 model:

```python
import langchain.agents as lc_agents
from IPython.display import display
from langchain_nvidia import NVIDIA

base_llm = NVIDIA(model="meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct", base_url="http://llm_client:9000/v1")

lc_agent_llm = base_llm

# Construct the ReAct agent
agent = lc_agents.create_react_agent(lc_agent_llm, toolbank, prompt)
agent_executor = lc_agents.AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=toolbank, verbose=True, handle_parsing_errors=True)

try:
    agent_executor.invoke(
        {
            "input": "what's my name? Only use a tool if needed, otherwise respond with Final Answer",
            # Notice that chat_history is a string, since this prompt is aimed at LLMs, not chat models
            "chat_history": "Human: Hi! My name is Bob\nAI: Hello Bob! Nice to meet you",
        },
        verbose=True
    )
except Exception as e:
    print("Exception:", e)
    print("\nInput:") or display(lc_agent_llm._client.last_inputs)
    print("\nOutput:") or display(getattr(lc_agent_llm._client.last_response, "json", lambda: None)(), None)
```

<br>

This version was a good start and pioneered many interesting examples when unguided autoregression was the main technique. Good examples would reinforce in-context tool calling, bad examples would cause complaints to be logged back to the LLM, and token stop conditions would ensure that the LLM wouldn't try to answer its own questions that it queued up.

### **Modern-Day ReAct:**

Since the idea of ReAct is so closely tied to the agent abstraction, it more or less grew legs as a general idea of "think about it, interact, see what happens, repeat." This combined with the emergence of tool selection/structured output evolved the term to encompass any agentic system that:

- **Has a central dialog loop.**
- **Can call tools at its disposal.**
- **Can respond to the user directly.**

In other words, **a ReAct agent is now just any agent with a running conversation buffer that can call a set of tools that include the user.** You're free to debate whether or not this is a sound evolution of the phrase, but it is catchy and intuitive enough and the term has since stuck.

We can try this new flavor of the ReAct loop in its default import form from the `langgraph` library, and we'll see a different set of results from its invocation:

```python
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from langchain_core.runnables.history import RunnableWithMessageHistory

checkpointer = MemorySaver()
langgraph_agent_executor = create_react_agent(llm, toolbank, checkpointer=checkpointer)

query = (
    # "Can you please calculate the first 20 digits of pi?"
    "Can you please calculate the first 20 digits of pi? Make sure to use the execute_python tool."
    # "Can you please pick a random color for me?"
    # "Can you please pick a random color for me with uniform probability?"
    # "Can you please tell me about NVIDIA's new DIGITS systems?"
    # "Can you please tell me about NVIDIA's new DIGITS systems? What do you know from your knowledge?"
)

config = {"configurable": {"session_id": "test-session", "thread_id": "test-thread"}}

messages = langgraph_agent_executor.invoke({"messages": [("human", query)]}, config=config)
{"input": query, "output": messages["messages"][-1].content}
```

We can try to check out the history and see that... it seems to be performing like expected:

```python
langgraph_agent_executor.get_state(config).values
```

<br>

That's because this version strongly assumes the ability to call tools through the tool-use API, and merely enforces the now-coined "ReAct Loop" as its main control flow:

```python
langgraph_agent_executor
```

<br>

We'll talk more about langgraph later, but you can try to run the executor once again to see what would happen if you wanted to ask a follow-up question:

```python
messages = langgraph_agent_executor.invoke({"messages": [("human", "Can you now see what happens when you use another tool?")]}, config=config)
messages["messages"][-1].content
```

```python
langgraph_agent_executor.get_state(config).values
```

<hr><br>

## **Part 4:** Server-Siding Tool Execution

By now we have examples of client-side tool selection and have just introduced server-side tool selection. In both cases, the endpoint is only responsible for the semantic part of the problem while the actual fulfillment remains a client-side burden. This isn't always the case, and there are some valid use-cases for server-side tooling and even automatic tooling support.

> <img src="images/tooling-patterns.png" style="width:1000px;"/>

#### **Wrapper Application/Agent:** 

Obviously you can create a wrapper application around an LLM with its own tooling assumptions and fulfillment strategies. Many such systems will be interfaced in much the same way as an LLM server (i.e. you stream or invoke the API), but will be calling plenty of tools, managing its own state, etc. This shouldn't be surprising, and is just a trivial inclusion of the microservice design pattern.

**Examples:** 
- A **retrieval microservice** may support the completion streaming API and may very well have structured output as an internal component, even if its main job is to interface with some knowledge base.
- A **chatbot persona** could be reduced to a high-level API which automatically honors state and picks from its set of pre-defined tools while maintaining a system prompt. If it's isolated to a server, its runtime could be moved to an arbitrary compute source and we could define arbitrary resource ownership/scaling rules.

#### **Test-Time Compute/Inference-Time Scaling:** 

There may be times where tooling, routing, or branching strategies are tightly interwoven with training or otherwise boost the performance of the model merely by being enforced in the background. In this case, you may see phrases like *"Test-Time Compute"* and *"Interence-Time Scaling"* getting thrown around without much definition (maybe described as "thinking"). These are vague terms with evolving meanings, and are technically synonymous: 
- **Test-Time** and **Inference-Time** merely mean that they are happening after the model has already been trained, and usually when it is actually running in the wild.
- **Compute** and **Scaling** (or *compute scaling*) suggests that there is extra compute being put into the decisions and output creation of the model, with potential emphasis on a substantial increase in processing effort.

The critical among you may notice that this *sounds* like an agentic workflow or an LLM pipeline... but now it gets sanctioned as an LLM inference feature? Technically speaking, there is usually an added implication that the model is trained to support this extra process OR through a lot of synthetic data OR a complementary extra model is also integrated into the loop that was specially-designed for this process, *but it's technically not a requirement*. 

**Examples:**
- **"Scaling-Adjacent:** A reasoning system that output chain-of-thought could have its output auto-expanded such that each process is either **performed in parallel (*branched*)**, **executed sequentially (*iterated*)**, or **combined together (*merged*)**. This may explode the inference time required for the processes, but may be considered a baked-in feature of the model since it's explicitly trained for this format.
- **"Compute-Adjacent:** This category is quite broad and could encompass almost any LLM orchestration efforts that make their way into an inference server. As an example, a model may be **evaluated and judged by some classifier or reward model** to better align the response as the output gets generated. This can be used to either make the inference heavier or lighter.
    - For the lighter option, techniques like **speculative decoding** (autoregressing a chunk of values at a time with a ligher-weight model until a token of high uncertainty is hit) and **dynamic guardrails** (pre-trained or progressively-trained embedding models used for classification) can be used to speed up inference.
    - For heavier options, using a **reward model to critique and guide** the generation generally leads to a severe slowdown but can be useful for critical scenarios. This is sometimes used for inference but is more common for training i.e. reinforcement learning.

The thing to remember with these 

#### **Tool Registration:** 

For scenarios that leverage complex workflows like branching while limiting access to the underlying model, parallelized tool calls can be quite challenging to fulfill through a network interface. For this reason, some more advanced workflows may limit the toolset to a finite list of pre-implemented options.

To offer more customization, one potential work-around is to have the client host their own tools via thread-safe endpoints (i.e. scalable/restrictive async methods) and allow them to register the tools as callable via the provided schema. Assuming this endpoint is accessible via a port interface, then the server can asynchronously call the hosted endpoints for fulfillment. This approach is noticeable in the [**Anthropic Model Context Protocol**](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol), and is technically just a microservice-style abstraction where an increasingly-marginalized closed-source server is interacting with a larger ecosystem of functions.

<hr><br>

### **Part 5:** Reflecting On This Exercise

You may notice that we didn't exactly paint "tooling" as a concrete abstraction. We've more-or-less just combined the following two statements to their logical conclusion:

> **"An LLM can make statements and decision" + "An LLM can be forced to output in a structure that can be interpretted by another system" = "You can use the outputs of an LLM system to interact with another system"**

And then we concluded that you can also modularize, offload, or auto-handle this at various levels of abstraction. This is fundamental and useful, and is how you can skip the user entirely, integrate them selectively, or force an overbearing dependency that's even more extreme that the basic user + LLM agent loop. It also doesn't even scratch the surface of ways in which you can route a system to define its own control flow:
- You can fine-tune a model or use an embedding model to help move around the control space.
- You can have a pool of expert systems which vote on the best routes to go, or try to express their reason and "certainty" in a particular direction.
- You can have random decisions and algorithmic conditional logic, which can be interesting its own right and should feel obvious.

But again, this is just all a logical extension from previous abstractions, and depend heavily on the qualities of the LLM and your willingness to work around them.

<h2><b>Notebook 3:</b> Using LangGraph For Agentic Loops</h2>
<br>

**Welcome to the third section of the course!**

We now know that we can lock an LLM client into various useful configurations; we can streamline or manually engineer interfaces around our LLM to enable routing, retrieval, software queries, etc. and can tackle challenges with this formulation at various levels of abstraction. We also briefly tried out LangGraph, which seemed to be the more recommended interface for LangChain's agentic support mechanisms. In this follow-on, we will formalize LangGraph around its pros and cons and see how we can leverage it to create a near-arbitrary agent system.

### **Learning Objectives:**
- What is LangGraph and why we should learn how to use it.
- How we can implement interesting agent systems using the LangGraph abstractions. 

<hr><br>

## **Part 1:** Reasoning In A Complex Environment

Recall our ideal agent definition that motivates our decomposition:
- An ideal agent can map any input to any output reasonably well, regardless of complexity or length.

**In the previous notebooks, we established that creating good output is inherently non-trivial with a typical LLM, but some techniques exist to improve the process:**
- **Chain of thought prompting** can help to put the agent on the correct track.
- **Algorithmic execution** can help an LLM solve problems with defined algorithms.
- **Structured output** can help an LLM parameterize to a given structure.

We've now defined how these abilities can be used to help route a system between tools, along paths, and towards desirable configurations. In this section, we're going to investigate the LangChain-recommended mechanisms for implementing such flexible systems, and also try to understand why they might actually be necessary.

#### **Tangent: Prerequisite Intuitions**

This course strongly assumes that you've taken some of the previous courses in the series, including possibly [**Building LLM Applications with Prompt Engineering**](https://learn.nvidia.com/courses/course-detail?course_id=course-v1:DLI+C-FX-11+V1), [**Rapid Application Development with LLMs**](https://learn.nvidia.com/courses/course-detail?course_id=course-v1:DLI+S-FX-26+V1), and [**Building RAG Agents with LLMs**](https://learn.nvidia.com/courses/course-detail?course_id=course-v1:DLI+S-FX-15+V1).

**If you've taken these courses, you will know that we *DO NOT NEED* a true agentic framework to have LLM-specified control flow.** All of these systems use some flavor of bespoke systems to create agents that fit with the narrative and allow for control flow modifications.

All of the following scenarios are completely viable mechanisms for implementing control flow with LLMs: 

```python
##########################################################
## Prompt Engineering-Based Fulfillment (in Prompt Eng)
while True:
    prompt = (
        "Chat with the person and be a helpful responding assistant."
        " If they want to stop, output <STOP> at the end of your message.\n\nUSER: " + input("[User]")
    )
    output = llm.invoke(prompt)
    if output.content.strip().endswith("<STOP>"):
        break

##########################################################
## Structured-Output Fulfillment (in RAG course)
llm_routes = {
    "logged_in": struct_llm1,
    "logged_out": struct_llm2,
    "reject_path": reject_llm,
}
llm_chain = llm_routes["logged_out"]
while True:
    prompt = "Fill out the person schema. If found in database, you will see a response. {schema}\n\n{input}"
    output_dict = llm_chain({"schema": schema, "input": input("[User]")})
    if output_dict.get("name") and to_db_query(output_dict):
        llm_chain = llm_routes["logged_in"]
    # ...

##########################################################
## Running-State Chain (in RAG Course)
retrieval_chain = (
    RunnablePassthrough() 
    ## {"input", **}
    | RunnablePassthrough.assign({"retrieval": retriever_chain}) 
    ## -> {"input", "retrieval", **}
    | RunnablePassthrough.assign({"requery": rephrase_chain})    
    ## -> {"input", "retrieval", "requery", **}
    | RunnablePassthrough.assign({"response": prompt | llm | StrOutputParser()})
    ## -> {"input", "retrieval", "requery", "response"}
).invoke({"input" : "hello world!"})
```

If you haven't taken these courses, that's ok! But we will be rolling straight into LangGraph to avoid retreading the same ground. The other courses can be revisited and are all available in a self-paced context.

> **The important thing to note: This is a framework made specifically for productionalizing agents!** It integrates a lot of complexity which may or may not be needed for simple LLM systems, but we will be rolling with it so that you can interface with state-of-the-art solutions by the end of this workshop.

<hr><br>

## **Section 2:** Introducing LangGraph

For this course, we will be introducing **[LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph)** as a new addition that allows us to manage the conversation flow using a state graph system. By leveraging LangGraph, we can define the agent's states, transitions, and actions in a structured manner, eliminating the need for a fully-custom event loop. This framework enhances scalability and maintainability, especially when dealing with multi-agent systems or intricate workflows. 

As any framework, it obviously has its marketing material which communicates tons of great feature sets, so we will just provide a link to the homepage for those interested. As the course progresses, you will figure out the key value adds and make up your own mind about its pros and cons - every framework has them, and all frameworks lead with the former.

<br>

#### Why Is LangGraph Great Overall?

<details>

- **Because it considers so much**. LangGraph is highly customizable to a fault and forces you to abide by best-practices and constraints that may make no sense when you're starting out... but will become impactful later when you actually try to customize, scale up, productionalize.
- **Because it's already widely-adopted**. There are many examples and off-the-shelf solutions floating around that people can start out with, and quite a few research projects and final deployments are made with it. 
- **Because the techniques are transferable**. If you can really understand LangGraph, the other frameworks and their pros/cons become easier to think about. If you only encounter the simplest framework, all subsequent frameworks will look overly-complicated.

</details>

#### Then Is LangGraph Better Than Custom?

<details>

- **When you know you need the abstractions:** Unlike our while-loop which we could massage into a workable multi-state system, LangGraph takes a state graph approach to modeling the agentic traversal process. As such, it incorporates design patterns which scale naturally to non-sequential and even dynamic routines.
- **When you don't know where to start, but know you want to productionalize:** Unlike our while-loop which we could massage into a workable multi-state system, LangGraph takes a state graph approach to modeling the agentic traversal process. As such, it incorporates design patterns which scale naturally to non-sequential and even dynamic routines.

</details>

#### When Is LangGraph Worse Than Custom?

<details>

- **When you just want to make a simple application with some LLMs and some prompts:** In order to account for various multi-agent-specific feature sets and edge cases, LangGraph implements some strong assumptions which greatly increase its learning curve. If you can implement your solutions in basic LangChain, the runnable paradigm is more than sufficient to streamline your pipeline and bypasses several layers of complexity introduced by LangGraph. If, on the other hand, you know you want to scale your application and can benefit from its well-thought-out features/examples, then perhaps it's worth diving in and getting comfortable.
- **When you need the deepest optimizations:** While LangGraph is amazing, there is still room beyond LangGraph for deeper optimizations and stronger modularization. Those looking to make highly-specialized microservices may be interested in custom multithreading/multiprocessing schemes, advanced graph algorithms, and advanced resource management strategies which LangGraph may not offer.
- **When you just want some persona agents:** You saw the CrewAI API. That one has a much flatter learning curve, but also is not as customizable and is quite tailored for its use-cases. If you would like a lighter approach, that's the pretty simple on-ramp (but will also be easy to backtrack to).

</details>

<br>

## **Part 3: Warming Up to the LangGraph Abstraction**

**LangGraph** sits on top of LangChain's lower-level runnables (LCEL) but introduces a stronger concept of **state** and **transitions**. At its core, you define:

1. **A State** (in Python terms, a typed dictionary) that captures the relevant information for your application.  
2. **Nodes**, each a Python function that *reads* from and *updates* that state.  
3. **Edges** that link these nodes in a directed graph—indicating how control should move from one node to another.

This is more than just "build a pipeline." By describing nodes and edges, you're essentially describing how your agent will traverse an environment of possibilities.

#### **Example:** A Simple 2-Node Graph

Below is a compact illustration of what an application implemented with this framework looks like in practice:

```python
from langchain_nvidia import ChatNVIDIA

llm = ChatNVIDIA(model="meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct", base_url="http://llm_client:9000/v1")
```

```python
import uuid
from typing import Optional
from typing_extensions import TypedDict

from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from langgraph.constants import START, END
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph
from langgraph.types import interrupt, Command
from functools import partial

```

#### Breaking Down the Flow

1. **START** → **input**:  
   - The system jumps from the built-in `START` placeholder to the node named `"input"`.  
   - `"input"` is tied to the function `edged_input()`, which *interrupts* to ask the user for input. That user input is stored as `state["human_value"]`.
       - Interrupt literally breaks the control flow and the graph execution ends into a paused state. 

3. **input** → **response**: Next, we go to `"response"`, calling the `response()` function.

    - It takes `state["human_value"]` (the user’s text) and passes it into `llm.invoke(...)`.  
    - The resulting LLM output is stored in `state["llm_response"]`.

5. **response** → **END**: And then, we will go to some last state.
   - We haven’t told LangGraph to proceed anywhere else. Without an additional edge from `"response"` to another node (or back to `"node"`), it will just end. In other words, the control flow halts into a rest state.
   - You can add more edges for more steps, or a loop that returns to `"input"` for multi-turn usage.

#### Actually Running It

There are many ways to run this new chain, and superficially it may look somewhat similar to the runnable stuff we were playing with earlier. However, you'll notice that the interrupt mechanism and state buffers require much more handling. Software engineers who need to deeply integrate this system with their other projects would rejoice from those, but those starting out may admittedly feel a bit lost.

```python
##################################################################
## Simple Invocation Example

## We can stream over it until an interrupt is received
for chunk in app_stream({"foo": "abc"}):
    print("Chunk Before Command:", repr(chunk))

## If an interrupt is recieved, we can resolve it and continue
if "__interrupt__" in chunk:
    command = Command(resume=input(chunk.get("__interrupt__")[0].value))

##################################################################
## Follow-Up Example (Without streaming is simple case, with streaming is advanced case)

stream_outputs = True

if not stream_outputs:
    ## Stream just the individual outputs from the state-writing buffer
    print("\nSending Command:", repr(command), "\n")
    for chunk in app_stream(command):
        print("\nChunk After Command:", repr(chunk))

else:
    ## Same thing, but actually populate the message stream with streamed responses auto-magically
    seen_metas = dict()
    for chunk, meta in app_stream(command, stream_mode="messages"):
        if meta.get("checkpoint_ns") not in seen_metas:
            print(f"[{meta.get('langgraph_node')}]: ", end="", flush=True)
            # print(f"\nNew Buffer Stream Meta: {meta}\n")
        seen_metas[meta.get("checkpoint_ns")] = meta
        if chunk.content:
            print(chunk.content, end="", flush=True)
        if chunk.response_metadata: # or chunk.usage_metadata: 
            print(f"\n\nChunk with response_metadata: {repr(chunk)}")
```

```python
app.get_state(config)
```

```python
# list(app.get_state_history(config))
```

```python
from IPython.display import Image, display
from langchain_core.runnables.graph import CurveStyle, MermaidDrawMethod, NodeStyles

display(Image(app.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png(draw_method=MermaidDrawMethod.API)))
```

## **Part 4:** Why Use A Graph Abstraction?

A common argument for why this abstraction is so good comes from the camp of classical dialog modeling folks who may argue that "this is just the correct way to think about dialog." There is an argument to be made here, and you're free to think about it. 

- **Graphs/Networks:** Each **node** is a function that processes or transforms part of your conversation or data. **Edges** specify permissible flows between nodes. For instance, you may want user input first, then an LLM call, then a summarization step, etc.

- **Finite State Machines (FSMs):** In classic FSM terms, each *distinct combination* of state variables and node identity can be interpreted as an FSM "state," and each **edge** is a transition triggered by certain conditions. For instance, the code below transitions from `[User Input Node]` to `[LLM Response Node]` unconditionally. In a richer scenario, you might condition on the user’s text.

- **Markov Chains:** If you’re dealing with stochastic or probability-driven transitions, you can think of each node and subsequent edges as forming a Markov chain. The key difference is that in Markov chains, transitions are typically governed by probability distributions. In LangGraph, you can incorporate your own branching logic—possibly using the LLM’s output to determine next steps.

<br>

**This is great and all, but some of you may not be convinced:**
- If you're trained in CS, you'll see that this is just a way of modeling process dependencies with explicit logic. Just like any programming language could.
- The especially critical may also find counter-examples where this abstraction, though sufficient, might be better off transposed such that the states are the nodes and the edges are functions. *Consider what a document mesh or a knowledge graphs might require, and why this transposed setup is interesting.*

So again, why do we need this if we already know how to code in Python? Well, it's actually not because it's trying to hide the coding and conditional logic from you. **It's trying to hide the agentic loop and its productionalization aspects from you.**

<br>

#### **The Agent Loop (For Our Purposes)**

Assume that the agentic decomposition is just a way of breaking down an intractibly-complex global function into local operations:

$$F(X) = \sum_{i=0}^n (e_i \circ f_i \circ d_i)(x_i) \text{ for $i$ agents and local environments } {\bigcup_i x_i} \subseteq X$$

Assume further that this system is especially useful to model system dynamics over time, such that we care about some future state $X_T$ transitioned from some initial state $X_0$ via our repeated application of $F(X)$. Specifically:

$$X_T = X_0 + \sum_{t=0}^{T-1}F(X_t) \text{ where } X_{t+1} = X_t + F(X_t)$$

And then assume that $t$ can be sampled at an arbitrarily-fine resolution, and you have the continuous agent equation! (Feel free to insert the integral in the $[0,T]$ interval, but not necessary). And that's how the real world functions!

In computers, agent-based simulations are also structured like this, and there exists a discrete time loop at some level of abstraction. The issues are:
- There are a discrete number of processes, and processes invoke other processes.
- For a given time-step, the number of processes can be very large or very small. Usually, this can can only be determined by observation.
- We like to observe, monitor, control, and version (time-travel), and this requires memory and compute overhead and hard design decisions.
- The number of processes can scale dramatically with the number of users, complexity of macro-processes, and increase or resources.

And we have reconstructed the problem of process management in computer architectures. Which we generally don't have to worry about. So why bother now?

**Because now we're doing it in an high-abstraction framework like Python where discrete-time simulation is very inefficient and hard to scale manually, and need the flexibility to define our own processes propagation, monitoring, concurrent execution, replication, and versioning.** And it turns out that's a challenge, as discussed in the lecture.

<br>

#### **Does that mean LangGraph is the Answer?**

LangGraph is AN answer, and has a relatively small barrier to entry given the level of customization it supports. Therefore, we will continue to use it as our chief abstraction for this course. It still has some clear limitations associated with it, and technically there are higher barrier-of-entry options that have less of those:
- **Custom graph systems** can be implemented using some key abstractions, and they can be truly customized for any arbitrary use-cases. This is, in fact, what LangGraph creates and supports under the hood. However, this problem explodes in complexity as you start implementing the feature sets necessary in modern-day LLM applications, and your solutions will be inherently bespoke unless released as a unified framework.
- [**NVIDIA Morpheus**](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/products/morpheus/) is another useful abstraction which offers advanced data pipeline solutions that could be used to pipe inference streams, track analytics, and optimize pipelines with CUDA-accelerated workflows. With that being said, it doesn't have all of the niceties associated with LangGraph for the agentic use-case. The Morpheus - LangGraph divide is similar to the LangGraph - CrewAI divide in terms of complexity, so it's not actually a bad idea to use, but will have less built-in conveniences.

## **Part 5:** [Exercise] Adding Simple Routing

Now that we're committed to our framework, let's conform to the framework's expectations and implement its signature feature; **routing**. In the immediate next notebook, we will have a more involved example which will show how to integrate the LangGraph event loop with structured output to implement our teased-upon persona agent system from Section 1. Before then, we wanted to include a simple exercise to augment the loop *just enough* to construct a stop condition. 

- The method `get_nth_message` is provided to get the last (or maybe some other) message from the state that is passed into it.
- Using this, try to force the loop to end when the user says "stop". Or maybe when the LLM says `stop`? One or the other is ok.
- The streaming logic has gotten more complicated and is now a generator than handles more cases (including other state buffer streams and the debug buffer). It is implemented in `stream_from_app_1`, and you should try to use it instead.
    - You can also import `stream_from_app` from `course_utils.py` (or transpose it as `from course_utils import stream_from_app`). This one is a bit better and interfaces with a web service!

## **Part 5:** Reflecting On This Exercise

For those of you just starting out with building agent systems of any kind, LangGraph may seem intimidating. In fact, many engineers who have more limited-scope problems can probably get by with just the LangChain abstractions from the previous sections (which the previous courses go into depth on). At the same time, more experienced engineers who have a strong grasp of agentic software paradigms can straddle the line anywhere between primitive-based and framework-enabled orchestration, and can hopefully make the right design decisions to enable their solution at any scale. 

We like to treat LangGraph as a great starting abstraction which works **by default** for some of the largest models, **with extra effort** for a selection of models, and **with significant modification** for an even-greater set of possible interfaces. *(Unfortunately, the Llama-8B model may fall under the middle or last category, as you will see in the next notebook)*. With that said, at least it has some simple ways into the ecosystem and can scale by default into production use-cases without too much hassle. As such, we will use this framework for the rest of the course as necessary to enable our agentic loops.

- In the next **Exercise Notebook**, we will leverage LangGraph to recreate our multi-persona abstraction with next-speaker selection and a custom state system to show that the framework is *at least* flexible enough to create near-arbitrary state interfaces.

<h2><b>Exercise 3:</b> Implementing Our Persona System In LangGraph</h2>
<br>

In the prior section, you explored using LangGraph to orchestrate nodes and edges for a basic agentic workflow. Now, let’s revisit our little persona agent problem from Section 1 involving the teacher, the student, and the parent. We now have a structured outputs and LangGraph experience, so maybe we can orchestrate our system using this new abstraction? You’ll see how to set up each persona’s data, create a unified prompt format, generate structured JSON responses, and chain these agents together in a state graph.

### **Learning Objectives:**
**In this notebook, we will:**

- Get some practice with LangGraph and get comfortable with its state management abstractions.
- Implement a proper attempt at routing based on the LLM's direction (in contrast to our failed ReAct attempts in Notebook 2t).

```python
from langchain_nvidia import ChatNVIDIA

llm = ChatNVIDIA(model="meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct", base_url="http://llm_client:9000/v1")
```

<hr><br>

### **Part 1:** Pulling In Our Personas

You may remember both our bespoke system in base Python and our streamlined system in CrewAI, so let's just pool those specifications together to create our couple of personas:

```python
teacher_args = dict(
    role="John Doe (Teacher)",
    backstory=(
        "You are a computer science teacher in high school holding office hours, and you have a meeting."
        " This is the middle of the semester, and various students have various discussion topics across your classes."
        " You are having a meeting right now. Please engage with the students and help their parent."
    ), 
    directive="You are having a meeting right now. Please engage with the other speakers and help them out with their concerns.",
)

student1_args = dict(
    role="Jensen (Student)",
    backstory="You are taking Dr. Doe's intro to algorithms course and are struggling with some of the homework problems.", 
    directive="Meet with your teacher to help you understand class material. Respond and ask directed questions, contributing to discussion.",
)

student2_args = dict(
    role="Albert (Student)",
    backstory="You are taking Dr. Doe's intro to algorithms course and are struggling with some of the homework problems.", 
    directive="Meet with your teacher to help you understand class material. Respond and ask directed questions, contributing to discussion.",
)

parent_args = dict(
    role="Sally (Parent)",
    backstory="You are here with your kids, who are students in the teacher's class.", 
    directive="Meet with your kids and the teacher to help support the students and see what you can do better.",
)

agent_unique_spec_dict = {args.get("role"):args for args in [teacher_args, student1_args, student2_args, parent_args]}
```

<br>

Now, let’s build a `ChatPromptTemplate` that is flexible enough to apply to each persona. You’ll see placeholders for:
- `{role}`, `{backstory}`, and `{directive}` from our agent specs.
- A space for the final `schema_hint`, which we will use to help route our system/
- The message placeholder which will contain our conversation messages so far.



```python
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from course_utils import SCHEMA_HINT  ## <- Convenience method to get schema hint template

## Define the structured prompt template
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    ("system", (
        "You are {role}. {backstory}"
        "\nThe following people are in the room: {role_options}."
        " {directive}\n" f"{SCHEMA_HINT}"
    )),
    ("placeholder", "{messages}"),
])
```

<hr><br>

### **Step 2:** Defining Our Response Schemas

Using a similar logic as in Notebook 2, we can endow our systems with structured output to help us not only get a natural language response, but also generate pathing variables which we can then use to route our conversation.

Guiding the decoding based on the legal pathways of the current state is a bit hard to manage, but can be controlled by tweaking the schema that is sent in to the LLM endpoint. A convenience method `get_finite_schema` is defined below.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Literal

## Definition of Desired Schema
class AgentResponse(BaseModel):
    """
    Defines the structured response of an agent in the conversation.
    Ensures that each agent response includes the speaker's identity,
    a list of response messages, and a defined routing option.
    """
    speaker: Literal["option1", "option2"] = Field(description="Who are you responding as?")
    response: List[str] = Field(description="Response to contribute to the conversation")
    route: Literal["option1", "option2"] = Field(description="A choice of the next person")

    @classmethod
    def get_default(cls):
        return cls(speaker="option1", response=[], route="option1")
    
    @classmethod
    def get_finite_schema(cls, key_options: Dict[str, List[str]]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """
        Dynamically modifies the schema to adjust the possible routing options.
        This is useful for ensuring the model respects dynamic conversation flows.
        """
        schema = cls.model_json_schema()
        for key, options in key_options.items():
            if "enum" in schema["properties"].get(key, {}):
                schema["properties"][key]["enum"] = options
            if "items" in schema["properties"].get(key, {}):
                schema["properties"][key]["items"] = {'enum': options, 'type': 'string'}
        return schema

role_options = list(agent_unique_spec_dict.keys()) + ["End"]
schema_hint = AgentResponse.get_finite_schema({"speaker": role_options[:1], "route": role_options})
schema_hint
```

<br>

And just like that, we now have both the local and global specification needed to populate our prompt template. These will serve as our arguments for constructing our purpose-build **Agent** class.

```python
## Shared parameters across agents
shared_args = dict(
    llm=llm, 
    schema=AgentResponse.get_default(), 
    schema_hint=schema_hint, 
    prompt=prompt, 
    routes=role_options, 
    roles=role_options
)

## Initialize agent specifications with shared parameters
agent_spec_dict = {
    role: {**unique_specs, **shared_args} 
    for role, unique_specs in agent_unique_spec_dict.items()
}
```

<hr><br>

### **Step 3:** Defining Our Agent Class

To help keep the complexity out of our final orchestration graph, we can implement some stateful agents just like the ones found in our CrewAI example. 

- To stick with our theory-guided approach towards agentics, the interface leading to and from the LLM are called `_convert_to_local` and `_convert_to_global`, respectively. If you check them out, you'll notice they look strikingly familiar.
- You'll notice that in `_get_llm`, we parameterize the `get_finite_method` with the classes that we may want our LLM to choose between (or have no choice over). Note that this is not an officially-supported method across LangChain/LangGraph, and is just there to simplify our codebase.
- We didn't really make noise about it last time, but you'll notice we're calling the llm with `.invoke`. It sure would be weird if it started streaming the outputs when we actually used the class...

```python
from langchain_core.output_parsers import JsonOutputParser 
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, ValidationError
from typing import List, Literal, Dict, Any
import ast


class Agent:
    """
    Represents an interactive agent that responds to messages in a structured format.
    Each agent is initialized with an LLM and a predefined prompt to ensure consistency.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, llm, prompt, role, routes, schema=None, **kwargs):
        self.llm = llm
        self.role = role
        self.prompt = prompt
        self.routes = routes
        self.schema = schema
        ## Let's funnel all of our prompt arguments into the default_kwargs
        self.default_kwargs = {**kwargs, "role": self.role, "role_options": "/".join(self.routes)}

    def __call__(self, config=None, **kwargs):
        """
        Calls the agent with a given message and retrieves a structured response.
        """
        kwarg_pool = {**self.default_kwargs, **kwargs}
        global_inputs = kwarg_pool.get("messages")

Make sure to take advantage of your message buffer. Maybe the first step is to add the generated message to the buffer? From there, we just need to route to the appropriate agent based on the response...

### **Part 4:** Putting It All Together

Now that we have all of these components, we can integrate them together to make our own agent system fit for the use-case. Much in the same way as before, we can do all of this with only a single agent abstraction, but each agent can just have their own class instance. As an exercise, see if you can't construct the agent class without looking at the solution!

```python
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from langgraph.constants import START, END
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph
from langgraph.types import interrupt, Command
from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages

from typing import Annotated, Dict, List, Optional, TypedDict
import operator

##################################################################
## Define the authoritative state system (environment) for your use-case

class State(TypedDict):
    """The Graph State for your Agent System"""
    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages] = []
    agent_dict: Dict[str, dict]
    speakers: List[str] = []  ## <- use this to keep track of routing/enqueueing

##################################################################
## Define the operations (Nodes) that can happen on your environment

def agent(state: State):
    """Edge option where transition is generated at runtime"""
    agent_dict = state.get("agent_dict")
    current_speaker = state.get("speakers")[-1]
    ## TODO: If a speaker is retrieved properly, construct the agent connector,
    ## generate the response, and route to the appropriate next speaker.
    if current_speaker in agent_dict:
        current_agent = Agent(**agent_dict[current_speaker])
        response = current_agent(**state)[0]
        return Command(update={
            "messages": [("ai", str(response))], 
            "speakers": [response.get("route")],
        }, goto="agent")

##################################################################
## Define the system that organizes your nodes (and maybe edges)

builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node("agent", agent)
builder.add_edge(START, "agent")  ## A start node is always necessary
```

```python
from course_utils import stream_from_app
from functools import partial
import uuid

checkpointer = MemorySaver()
app = builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": uuid.uuid4()}, "recursion_limit": 1000}
app_stream = partial(app.stream, config=config)

## We can stream over it until an interrupt is received

initial_inputs = {"messages": [], "agent_dict": agent_spec_dict, "speakers": list(agent_spec_dict.keys())[:1]}
for token in stream_from_app(app_stream, input_buffer=[initial_inputs], verbose=False, debug=False):
    if token == "[Agent]: ":
        print("\n", flush=True)
    print(token, end="", flush=True)
    
```

### **Part 5:** Reflecting On This Exercise

This may very well be the hardest system you've implemented today. We had to conform to the LangGraph logic, define some custom non-intuitive utilities, and validate our decisions every step of the way. By now you probably can see that this is **significantly harder** than our approach in CrewAI, and that's ok! Part of the appeal of LangGraph is that it is, in fact, a highly-customizable solution which can scale to production with relative ease and a high amount of observability/control defined at any level.

You may recall that the LangGraph ReAct loop didn't work very well out-of-the-box from our model, though it was implemented in a sound way such that a different model will actually work better. The fact that we could completely undercut this abstraction and make it exactly like we wanted to, as we did here, is the real feature to appreciate. And also, we needed to offer some practice before the assessment, so... it works out!

**In the next section, get ready to try out the assessment to see if you can make an interesting research agent based on the tools we've discussed today! (But before then, the warm-up may be of interest)**

<h2><b>Assessment Warm-Up:</b> Creating A Basic Retriever Node</h2>
<br>

We've now been introduced to ReAct as a concept, and could make a toy system that exhibits this property. However, focusing on it as the ideal paradigm isn't necessarily always correct. It is extremely flexible and does have its purposes. When organized by an overarching strong LLM, this type of loop can run for quite a while since the tools can be used to hide details from the main loop. Integrate this system in with some context re-canonicalization step, and you could theorhetically go on forever.

From an implementation perspective, creating a coherent system with this is actually quite simple in principle. It's a good exercise, but isn't worth the effort to build in this course as it doesn't show off any new features:

> **HINT:** It's the agent loop from Section 3, but the LLM is bound to call functions, the stop condition is when no tool is called, and some effort is needed to make sure the tool responses actually help to enforce a valid prompting strategy.

This paradigm is great for ***horizontal agents*** and ***supervisor-style nodes***, where you can keep tossing more functions ("ways to interface with the environment") at the LLM while hoping it will pick something up. Hence, why this pattern works better with a stronger LLM where the state of "it just works" is easier to achieve.

In this notebook, we will try implementing a ***tool-like agent*** system which is tweaked for the specific problem and aims to hide its runtime details from any other main event loops which may be overseeing it. (i.e. the user, an overarching ReAct loop, some other supervisor, etc). In doing so, we will rediscover some of the interfaced from the RAG course while recontextualizing them into our LangGraph workflows.

**This exercise is specifically intended to prepare you for the assessment!**

```

<hr><br>

## **Part 1:** Pulling In Some Boilerplate

Let's start off by pulling in our old-reliable base specification for a simple multi-turn system. To make this and subsequent processes easier, we will switch to using an entirely Command-based routing scheme, and will try to reuse components as they need integration.

```python
import uuid
from typing import Annotated, Optional
from typing_extensions import TypedDict

from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from langgraph.constants import START, END
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph
from langgraph.types import interrupt, Command
from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages
from functools import partial
from colorama import Fore, Style
from copy import deepcopy
import operator
from course_utils import stream_from_app

##################################################################

class State(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]
    
##################################################################

def user(state: State):
    update = {"messages": [("user", interrupt("[User]:"))]}
    return Command(update=update, goto="agent")
    
def agent(state: State, config=None):
    update = {"messages": [llm.invoke(state.get("messages"), config=config)]}
    if "stop" in state.get("messages")[-1].content: 
        return update
    return Command(update=update, goto="start")
    
##################################################################

builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node("start", lambda state: {})
builder.add_node("user", user)
builder.add_node("agent", agent)
builder.add_edge(START, "start")
builder.add_edge("start", "user")
app = builder.compile(checkpointer=MemorySaver())
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": uuid.uuid4()}}
app_stream = partial(app.stream, config=config)

for token in stream_from_app(app_stream, verbose=False, debug=False):
    print(token, end="", flush=True)
```

<br>

In this notebook, we will be combining our simple LangGraph app with the logic of our DLI Instructor prompt from earlier. You may recall that implementation looked something like the following:

```python
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser
from langchain_nvidia import ChatNVIDIA
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from functools import partial

## Back-and-forth loop
core_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    ("system",
         "You are a helpful instructor assistant for NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute (DLI). "
         " Please help to answer user questions about the course. The first message is your context."
         " Restart from there, and strongly rely on it as your knowledge base. Do not refer to your 'context' as 'context'."
    ),
    ("user", "<context>\n{context}</context>"),
    ("ai", "Thank you. I will not restart the conversation and will abide by the context."),
    ("placeholder", "{messages}")
])

## Am LCEL chain to pass into chat_with_generator
chat_chain = core_prompt | llm | StrOutputParser()

with open("simple_long_context.txt", "r") as f:
    full_context = f.read()

long_context_state = {
    "messages": [],
    "context": full_context,
}

from course_utils import chat_with_chain

chat = partial(chat_with_chain, chain=chat_chain)
chat(long_context_state)
```

<br>

You may also recall that this system was only able to take a couple of questions at a time because the context length would quickly exceed the deployed model's limits. We will try to fix that as part of our exercise!

<hr><br>

## **Part 2:** Filtering Out The Details

Understanding that the context length of our content chatbot is too limited, you may feel included to refine it some more and get down to an even smaller context, but our current entries are already relatively short. 

```python
from langchain_core.documents import Document

context_entries = full_context.split("\n\n")
context_docs = [Document(page_content=entry) for entry in context_entries if len(entry.split("\n")) > 2]
context_lens = [token_len(d.page_content) for d in context_docs]
print(f"Context Token Length: {sum(context_lens)} ({sum(context_lens)/len(context_lens):.2f} * {len(context_lens)})")
print(f"Document Token Range: [{min(context_lens)}, {max(context_lens)}]")
```

Perhaps we could invoke some heuristic to help us know which ones to focus on for any given question. Lucky for us, we have several viable heuristics in the form of **embedding models**! These have been covered at length in other courses, so here's just a high-level overview:

**Instead of *autoregressing* a sequence out of another sequence as a response/continuation, an encoder *embeds* the sequence into a per-token embedding, of which a subset (zero-th entry, subset, entire sequence) is used as a semantic encoding of the input.** Let's see which model options we have at our displosal.

- A **reranking model** orders a set of document pairs by relevance as its default behavior. This style of model is usually implemented with a *cross-encoder*, which takes both sequences as input and directly predicts a relevance score while actively considering both sequences.
- An **embedding model** embeds a document into a semantic embedding space as its default behavior. This style of model is usually implemented with a *bi-encoder*, which takes in one sequence at a time to produce the embedding. However, two embedded entries can be compared using some similarity metric (i.e. cosine similarity).

Either model could technically be used for retrieval, so let's go ahead and try both options!

```python
from langchain_nvidia import NVIDIAEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS

## First, we can try out the embedding model, which is commonly used by first constructing a vectorstore.
## - Pros: If you have m documents and n queries, you need n inference-time embeddings and m*n similarity comparisons. 
## - Cons: Prediction of d_i sim q_j uses learned embeddings Emb_D(d_i) and Emb_Q(q_i),
##         not a joint learned representation Emb(d_i, q_j). In other words, somewhat less accurate.

question = "Can you tell me about multi-turn agents?"

embed_d = NVIDIAEmbeddings(model="nvidia/llama-3.2-nv-embedqa-1b-v2", base_url='http://llm_client:9000/v1', truncate='END', max_batch_size=128)
embed_q = NVIDIAEmbeddings(model="nvidia/llama-3.2-nv-embedqa-1b-v2", base_url='http://llm_client:9000/v1', truncate='END', max_batch_size=128) ## Not necessary
vectorstore = FAISS.from_documents(context_docs, embed_d)
vectorstore.embedding_function = embed_q
retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever()
%time retriever.invoke(question, k=5)
# %time retriever.invoke(question, k=1)
```

```python
from langchain_nvidia import NVIDIARerank

## Next, we can try out the reranking model, which is queried directly to get predicted relevance scores.
## - Pros: Literally predicts Emb(d_i, q_i), so better joint relationships can be learned. 
## - Cons: If you have m documents and n queries, you need n*m inference-time embeddings. 

question = "Can you tell me about multi-turn agents?"

reranker = NVIDIARerank(model="nvidia/llama-3.2-nv-rerankqa-1b-v2", base_url='http://llm_client:9000/v1', top_n=5, max_batch_size=128)
%time reranker.compress_documents(context_docs, question)
```

```python
# reranker._client.last_inputs
# reranker._client.last_response.json()
# embed_d._client.last_inputs
# embed_d._client.last_response.json()
# embed_q._client.last_inputs
# embed_q._client.last_response.json()
```

<br>

As we can see, this process is very fast at identifying similarities and produces pretty good rankings for this small data pool! More generally:
- **The reranking model is greatly preferred when we're dealing with a small pool of values,** since it leverage joint conditioning.
- **The embedding model is greatly preferred when dealing with large document pools,** since we can offload much of the embedding burden to the preprocessing stage.

For our limited use-case, the choice won't really matter, and you are free to use whichever option you find most compelling. With that said, go ahead and define a `retrieve` function to abstract this decision away. Furthermore, to streamline our handling later down the road, let's also return just the final string content so that we have less problems to worry about later. 

```python
def retrieve_via_query(query: str, k=5):
    reranker = NVIDIARerank(model="nvidia/llama-3.2-nv-rerankqa-1b-v2", base_url='http://llm_client:9000/v1', top_n=k, max_batch_size=128)
    rets = reranker.compress_documents(context_docs, query)
    return [entry.page_content for entry in rets]

retrieve_via_query(question)
```

<br>

From here, we can either make it into a "schema function," a "tool," or a "node," with the following key destinctions:
- A **schema function** can be bound to an LLM to force the output to the schema unconditionally.
- A **tool** is also a schema function, but is defined implicitly (i.e. structure of input is implied from signature) and is easier to toss into a tolbank.
- A **node** operates on and writes to the state buffer of a graph, so it should take in a `state` + `config`, operate on state variables, and output a state buffer modification request.

In this exercise, we're actually going to use the retrieval as an always-on feature of the "retrieval" agent, so we can bypass the first two and directly make our node function. Let's assume:
- We want our node to perform a retrieval on the previous message (i.e. we want the retrieval to happen AFTER the user submits a message, and we want to retrieve based on whatever the user sent).
- We want to write the retrieval results to a value `context` to the state buffer, as we will want the next node (an LLM generation) to use the context.
    - And we will want to accumulate `context` over time to include all relevant retrievals. That way, we can put the retrieval into the system message and it can continue to contribute to all subsequent outputs. This implies we'll want to store the values in a set...

```python
def retrieval_node(state: State, config=None, out_key="context"):
    ## NOTE: Very Naive; Assumes user question is a good query
    ret = retrieve_via_query(state.get("messages")[-1].content, k=3)
    return {out_key: set(ret)}

## After we define the node, we can assess whether or not it would work.

## Given an initial empty state...
state = {
    "messages": [], 
    "context": set(),
}

## Given an update rule explaining how to handle state updates...
add_sets = (lambda x,y: x.union(y))

## Will the continued accumulation of messages, followed by a continued accumulation of retrievals, function properly?
state["messages"] = add_messages(state["messages"], [("user", "Can you tell me about agents?")])
state["context"] = add_sets(state["context"],  retrieval_node(state)["context"])
print(f"Retriever: {state['context']} ({len(state['context'])})")

state["messages"] = add_messages(state["messages"], [("user", "How about earth simulations?")])
state["context"] = add_sets(state["context"],  retrieval_node(state)["context"])
print(f"\nContext: {state['context']} ({len(state['context'])})")

state["messages"] = add_messages(state["messages"], [("user", "How about earthly agents?")])
state["context"] = add_sets(state["context"],  retrieval_node(state)["context"])
print(f"\nContext: {state['context']} ({len(state['context'])})")
```

## **Part 3:** Adding Retrieval To Our Graph 

Now that we have a generally-applicable node with some base assumptions, let's integrate it into our dialog loop from earlier and see if it just works.

```python
import uuid
from typing import Annotated, Optional
from typing_extensions import TypedDict

from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from langgraph.constants import START, END
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph
from langgraph.types import interrupt, Command
from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages
from functools import partial
from colorama import Fore, Style
from copy import deepcopy
import operator

##################################################################
## Define the authoritative state system (environment) for your use-case

class State(TypedDict):
    """The Graph State for your Agent System"""
    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]
    context: Annotated[set, (lambda x,y: x.union(y))]

agent_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    ("system",
         "You are a helpful instructor assistant for NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute (DLI). "
         " Please help to answer user questions about the course. The first message is your context."
         " Restart from there, and strongly rely on it as your knowledge base. Do not refer to your 'context' as 'context'."
    ),
    ("user", "<context>\n{context}</context>"),
    ("ai", "Thank you. I will not restart the conversation and will abide by the context."),
    ("placeholder", "{messages}")
])

    update = {"messages": [("user", interrupt("[User]:"))]}
    return Command(update=update, goto="retrieval_router")

    return Command(update=retrieval_node(state), goto="agent")
    
def agent(state: State, config=None):
    update = {"messages": [(agent_prompt | llm).invoke(state, config=config)]}
    if "stop" in state.get("messages")[-1].content: 
        return update
    return Command(update=update, goto="start")
    
##################################################################

builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node("start", lambda state: {})
builder.add_node("user", user)
## TODO: Register the new router to the nodepool
builder.add_node("retrieval_router", retrieval_router)
builder.add_node("agent", agent)
builder.add_edge(START, "start")

app_stream = partial(app.stream, config=config)

for token in stream_from_app(app_stream, verbose=False, debug=False):
    print(token, end="", flush=True)
```

<hr>

As you can see, it wasn't too hard to integrate with the way this graph system is defined. We now have an "always-on" retrieval system which is always going to naively take our last message and retrieve the most relevant resources for our query... allegedly. However, if you play around with it a bit, you should start to notice that the raw input may not be exactly optimal, so most setups like to first rephrase the input into the canonical input form for the embedding model... but that would introduce latency and increase the time-to-first-token, making our system less responsive. 



<br><hr>

## **Part 4:** Adding A "Think Deeper" Mechanism

In this section, we're going to take some minor inspiration from ReAct to give our system multiple levels of thoroughness. Since our retrieval above was so light and is probably sufficient for most use-cases, let's keep it in. However, let's add a more rigorous thinking process that forces both a **query refinement** and a **web search** as part of its execution. 

This type of mechanism is often called a "reflection" mechanism since it can evaluate the output of the LLM and try to correct the execution flow. It largely works from the intuition that it's easier to verify if an output looks good than to generate the output in the first place.

We can achieve the querying logic with a single structured output schema, which we can test out below:

```python
from course_utils import SCHEMA_HINT
from langchain_core.output_parsers import PydanticOutputParser
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import List, Dict

class Queries(BaseModel):
    """Queries to help you research across semantic and web resources for more information. Specifically focus on the most recent question."""
    big_questions: List[str] = Field(description="Outstanding questions that need research, in natural language")
    semantic_queries: List[str] = Field(description="Questions (3 or more) to ask an expert to get more info to help, expressed in different ways.")
    web_search_queries: List[str] = Field(description="Questions (3 or more) that will be sent over to a web-based search engine to gather info.")

def query_node(state: State):
    if not state.get("messages"): return {"queries": []}
    chat_msgs = [
        ("system", SCHEMA_HINT.format(schema_hint = Queries.model_json_schema())),
        ("user", "Corrent Conversation:\n" + "\n\n".join([f"[{msg.type}] {msg.content}" for msg in state.get("messages")])),
    ]
    schema_llm = llm.with_structured_output(schema=Queries.model_json_schema(), strict=True)
    response = Queries(**schema_llm.invoke(chat_msgs))
    return {"queries": [response]}

add_queries = (lambda l,x: l+x) 

state = {
    "messages": [], 
    "queries": [],
}
state["messages"] = add_messages(state["messages"], [("user", "Can you tell me about agents?")])
state["queries"] = add_queries(state["queries"],  query_node(state)["queries"])
print("Queries:", state["queries"])

state["messages"] = add_messages(state["messages"], [("user", "How about earth simulations?")])
state["queries"] = add_queries(state["queries"],  query_node(state)["queries"])
print("\nQueries:", state["queries"])
```

<br>

Now, we have to actually fulfill those requests, so let's bring in both our retrieval function from this notebook and our DDGS search tool from the previous notebook and actually fulfill those requests.

```python
## HINT: You can paste the retrieval node and search tools directly and just resolve them in fulfill_query

# from langchain.tools import tool
# 
# @tool
# def search_internet(user_question: List[str], context: List[str], final_query: str):
#     """Search the internet for answers. Powered by search engine, in Google search format."""
#     from ddgs import DDGS
#     return DDGS().text(final_query, max_results=10)

# def retrieval_node(state: State, config=None, out_key="context"):
#     ## NOTE: Very Naive; Assumes user question is a good query
#     ret = retrieve_via_query(get_nth_message(state, n=-1), k=3)
#     return {out_key: set(ret)}

def fulfill_queries(queries: Queries, verbose=False):
    # big_questions: List[str]
    # semantic_queries: List[str]
    # web_search_queries: List[str]
    from ddgs import DDGS
    web_queries = queries.web_search_queries + queries.big_questions
    sem_queries = queries.semantic_queries + queries.big_questions
    # if verbose: print(f"Querying for retrievals via {web_queries = } and {sem_queries = }")
    web_ret_fn = lambda q: [
        str(f"{v.get('body')} [Snippet found from '{v.get('title')}' ({v.get('href')})]") 
        for v in DDGS().text(q, max_results=4)
    ]
    sem_ret_fn = retrieve_via_query
    web_retrievals = [web_ret_fn(web_query) for web_query in web_queries]
    sem_retrievals = [sem_ret_fn(sem_query) for sem_query in sem_queries]
    # if verbose: print(f"Generated retrievals: {web_retrievals = } and {sem_retrievals = }")
    return set(sum(web_retrievals + sem_retrievals, []))

retrievals = set()
new_rets = fulfill_queries(state["queries"][0], verbose=True)
retrievals = retrievals.union(new_rets)
print(f"Retrieved {len(new_rets)} chunks from the internet and the knowledge base")
new_rets
```

<br>

And perfect! We now have an unusably-long context that is, admittedly, better-thought-out but intractably long. Lucky for us, we have a pretty streamlined way of subsetting this with our retriever system, if only we generalize it a bit more.

In the following cell, please implement a `format_retrieval` function to create the actual context for the system.

```python
def filter_retrieval(
    queries: Queries, 
    new_retrievals: list[str], 
    existing_retrievals: set[str] = set(), 
    k=5
):
    # big_questions: List[str]
    # semantic_queries: List[str]
    # web_search_queries: List[str]
    reranker = NVIDIARerank(model="nvidia/llama-3.2-nv-rerankqa-1b-v2", base_url='http://llm_client:9000/v1', top_n=(k + len(existing_retrievals)), max_batch_size=128)
    docs = [Document(page_content = ret) for ret in new_retrievals]
    rets = reranker.compress_documents(docs, "\n".join(queries.big_questions))
    return [entry.page_content for entry in rets if entry.page_content not in existing_retrievals][:k]

filtered_retrieval = filter_retrieval(state["queries"][0], new_rets)
filtered_retrieval
```

<br>

And to wrap all of that up, proceed to make a single unified node call that executes this process as part of the routine, preferably without ever writing to the state buffer until the final new retrievals are generated.

**We will leave the final combination as an exercise, but the solution is provided for those interested.** After all, this should be prep for the assessment.

### **Part 5:** Reflecting On This Exercise

And just like that, we have some semblance of a ReAct-style loop, if in a much more limited capacity. Though it's not a "pool of tools" approach, it is definitely a "reflection system" with build-in routing. It also isn't really a proper "deep researcher" since it doesn't actually read the full body of the articles and isn't capable of expanding on the material quite yet, but it does exhibit very basic retrieval simplification to enable a much longer exchange window.

**In the next section, get ready to try out the assessment where you will be implementing a reasoning and searching feature based on the techniques presented in this notebook!**

<h1 style="line-height: 1.4;"><font color="#76b900"><b>Building Agentic AI Applications with LLMs</h1>
<h2><b>Assessment:</b> Creating A Basic Researching Agent</h2>
<br>

**Welcome To The Assessment!** We hope you're ready to apply some of the skills you've learned so far towards building something you've probably seen floating around; a "researching" chatbot. The overall idea should be pretty familiar:

- **The chatbot should look at your question and look around the internet for some resources.**
- **Based on those resources, the chatbot should make an educated guess based on its retrieved information.**

This is implemented often in conjunction with LLM interfaces like ChatGPT and Perplexity, and various open-source efforts have cropped up to simplify the process. With that being said, they usually don't rely on the likes of 8B models due to the finicky nature of routing them properly. As such, we will merely be testing you on your ability to implement the following primitives: 
- **A structured output interface to produce a parseable list.**
- **A function to search for web snippets and filter out the most relevant results.**
- **A mechanism for accumulating message beyond the control of the user.**
- **Some basic prompt engineering artifacts.**

Of note, there are many extensions which you should be able to imagine at this point. Perhaps we could have a requerying mechanism somewhere? Or maybe either the user or the agent could criticize and remove entries from the history? Long-term memory does sound appealing, after all. However, we will be focusing on just our simple features as required for two key reasons:
- **First, we really don't want to force you to do more engineering than you have to.** Frameworks like LangGraph may have many levers and introduce new primitives very quickly in an attempt to simplify the interface, so any overengineering we do now may become deprecated by the time you're reading this with some simpler off-the-shelf options.
- **Secondly, our Llama-3.1-8B model inherently makes this more challenging for us due to its limitations.** This level of challenge is important to understand and work with, since you are better-equipped to decompose harder challenges and leverage your tools to their fullest as you scale up. With that said, a multi-turn long-term-memory research agent implemented with Llama-8B is quite tedious at the moment, with many of the streamlines interfaces assuming a stronger model.

```python
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser
from langchain_nvidia import ChatNVIDIA

llm = ChatNVIDIA(model="meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct", base_url="http://llm_client:9000/v1")
```

<hr><br>

## **Part 1:** Define The Planner

For the initial system, please make a minimal-viable "supervisor"-style element which tries to delegate tasks. This is a very vague definition, so technically a module that generates a list of tasks is technically viable. So let's start with that!

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from functools import partial
from typing import List

from course_utils import SCHEMA_HINT

##################################################################
## TODO: Create an LLM client with the sole intention of generating a plan.

class Plan(BaseModel):
    ## TODO: Define a variable of choice, including useful prompt engineering/restrictions
    pass

planning_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    ("system", (
        "You are a master planner system who charts out a plan for how to solve a problem."
        ## TODO: Perform some more prompt engineering. Maybe consider including the schema_hint
    )),
    ("placeholder", "{messages}"),
])

## TODO: Construct the necessary components to create the chain
planning_chain = None

input_msgs = {"messages": [("user", "Can you help me learn more about LangGraph?")]}

## For convenience, we have defined a 
step_buffer = []
for chunk in planning_chain.stream(input_msgs):
    if "steps" in chunk:
        if len(chunk.get("steps")) > len(step_buffer):
            if step_buffer:
                print(flush=True)
            step_buffer += [""]
            print(" - ", end='', flush=True)
        dlen = len(chunk.get("steps")[-1]) - len(step_buffer[-1])
        step_buffer[-1] = chunk.get("steps")[-1]
        print(step_buffer[-1][-dlen:], end="", flush=True)
```

<br>

In an effort to help modularize this process for later, feel free to use this generator wrapper. This is effectively just the same process, but now yielding the results out to be processed by its caller:

```python
def generate_thoughts(input_msgs, config=None):
    step_buffer = [""]
    for chunk in planning_chain.stream(input_msgs, config=config):
        if "steps" in chunk and chunk.get("steps"):
            if len(chunk.get("steps")) > len(step_buffer):
                yield step_buffer[-1]
                step_buffer += [""]
            dlen = len(chunk.get("steps")[-1]) - len(step_buffer[-1])
            step_buffer[-1] = chunk.get("steps")[-1]
    yield step_buffer[-1]
    print("FINISHED", flush=True)

from time import sleep

for thought in generate_thoughts(input_msgs):
    
    print("-", thought)
    
    ## Example Use-Case: Slowing down the generation
    # for token in thought:
    #     print(token, end="", flush=True)
    #     sleep(0.02)
    # print(flush=True)
    # sleep(0.1)
```

<hr><br>

## **Task 2:** Define The Retrieval Sub-Process Mechanism

Now that we have a list of steps that we would like to consider, let's use them as a basis for searching the internet. Try implementing a searching mechanism of choice, and try to parallelize/batch this process if possible. 

- Feel free to implement `search_internet` and `retrieve_via_query` in a manner consistent with the warm-up (`DDGS` + `NVIDIARerank`), or maybe write up your own scheme that you think would be interesting. It may be interesting to implement a loop (agent-as-a-tool?) where you search, expand context, filter, and search again. Conceptually easy, but implementationally more involved.
- You may use the `tools` format if you want, but it will not be necessary. Do as you think is interesting.
- Our solutions did use `RunnableLambda(...).batch` at some point. Some solutions may also try to leverage `RunnableParallel`. Either-or may be useful, but are not required.

```python
# from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableLambda
# from ddgs import DDGS
# import functools

####################################################################
## TODO: Implement a "step researcher" mechanism of choice
## We incorporated a 2-step process similar to the example notebook.

# @functools.cache  # <- useful for caching duplicate results
# def search_internet(final_query: str): 
#     ## OPTIONAL: We ended up defining this method
#     pass 
     
def research_options(steps):
    return [] ## TODO

search_retrievals = research_options(step_buffer)
# search_retrievals
```

```python
# from langchain_nvidia import NVIDIARerank
# from langchain_core.documents import Document

## Optional Scaffold
def retrieve_via_query(context_rets, query: str, k=5):
    return [] ## TODO

filtered_results = [retrieve_via_query(search_retrievals, step) for step in step_buffer]
# filtered_results
```

<hr><br>

## **Part 3:** Creating The Research Pipeline

Now that we have some minimum-viable semblance of a supervisor/subordinate system, let's go ahead and orchestrate them in an interesting way. Feel free to come up with your own mechanism for "reasoning" about the question and "researching" the results. If you don't see a straightforward way to make it work, a default pool of prompts is offered below (possibly the ones we used).

```python
## TODO: Define the structured prompt template. Doesn't have to be this!
agent_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    ("system", 
     "You are an agent. Please help the user out! Questions will be paired with relevant context."
     " At the end, output the most relevant sources for your outputs, being specific."
    ),
    ("placeholder", "{messages}"),
])

intermediate_prompt = "I can help you look into it. Here's the retrieval: {action} -> {result}" 
final_question = "Great! Now use this information to solve the original question: {question}"
```

```python
question = "Can you help me learn more about LangGraph?"
# question = "Can you help me learn more about LangGraph? Specifically, can you tell me about Memory Management?"
# question = "Can you help me learn more about LangGraph? Specifically, can you tell me about Pregel?"
# question = "Can you help me learn more about LangGraph? Specifically, can you tell me about subgraphs?"
# question = "Can you help me learn more about LangGraph? Specifically, can you tell me about full-duplex communication?"
# question = "Can you help me learn more about LangGraph? Specifically, can you tell me about productionalization?"
## TODO: Try your own highly-specialized questions that shouldn't be answerable from priors alone. 

input_msgs = {"messages": [("user", question)]}

#########################################################################
## TODO: Organize a systen  to reason about your question progressively.
## Feel free to use LangChain or LangGraph. Make sure to wind up with 
## a mechanism that that remembers the reasoning steps for your system

sequence_of_actions = [thought for thought in generate_thoughts(input_msgs)]
## ...

## HINT: We ended up with a for-loop that accumulated intermediate "question-answer" pairs
## You may also consider a map-reduce-style approach to operate on each step independently.

# for action, result in zip(sequence_of_actions, filtered_results):  ## <- possible start-point
#     pass

input_msgs["messages"] += []

# ## HINT: If you wind up with a chain, this may be easy to work with...
# print("*"*64)
# for token in chain.stream(input_msgs):
#     if "\n" in token:
#         print(flush=True)
#     else: 
#         print(token, end="", flush=True)
```

<hr><br>

## **Part 4:** Accumulating Your Reasoning Traces

Depending on the structure of your system, the last requirement may be trivial or might take a bit of extra effort. Please aggregate the answers to 8 diverse and reasonable questions, while also accumulating the trace (i.e. the "reasoning", projected to an understandable format). 

This output will be evaluated by an LLM to assess whether the response seems to exhibit reasonable behavior (reasoning makes sense, final output addresses question, sources are cited, etc).

```python
## TODO: Aggregate 8 question-trace-answer triples. 
# [ 
#   {"question": str, "trace": list or dict or str, "answer": str}, 
#   ...
# ]

submission = [{}]
```

<hr>
<br>

## **Part 5:** Running The Assessment

To assess your submission, run the following cells to save your results and the one after to query the assessment runner.

**Follow the instructions and make sure it all passes.**

```python
import requests

## Send the submission over to the assessment runner
response = requests.post(
    "http://docker_router:8070/run_assessment", 
    json={"submission": submission},
)

response.raise_for_status()

try: 
    print(response.json().get("result"))
    if response.json().get("messages"):
        print("MESSAGES:", "\n  - ".join([""] + response.json().get("messages")))
    if response.json().get("exceptions"):
        print("EXCEPTIONS:", "\n[!] ".join([""] + [str(v) for v in response.json().get("exceptions")]))
except:
    print("Failed To Process Assessment Response")
    print(response.__dict__)
```
