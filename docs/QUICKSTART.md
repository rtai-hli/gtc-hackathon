# 🚀 Quick Start - 30 Second Setup

## Instant Demo

```bash
# You're already ready! No dependencies to install!
python demo.py
```

That's it! The demo runs immediately with zero setup.

## What You'll See

```
🚨 Incident detected: API latency spike

👀 Watch as the Incident Commander:
   🤔 Assesses the situation
   ⚡ Delegates to specialist agents
   👁️ Synthesizes evidence
   ✅ Determines root cause

Result: "Database connection pool exhaustion"
Confidence: 85%
```

## Demo Modes

### Full Demo (Colored Output + Summary)
```bash
python demo.py
```

### Simple Mode (Clean Output)
```bash
python demo.py --simple
```

### Interactive Mode (Step-Through)
```bash
python demo.py --interactive
```

## Key Features (Already Working!)

✅ **Observable Reasoning**: See agents think in real-time
✅ **Event-Driven**: Agents emit structured events
✅ **Multi-Phase Workflow**: 4-phase incident response
✅ **Visual Output**: Color-coded with emoji indicators
✅ **Zero Dependencies**: Pure Python, runs anywhere

## Next Steps

**For Hackathon**: See [HACKATHON_GUIDE.md](HACKATHON_GUIDE.md) for 90-min roadmap

**For Architecture**: See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for design details

**For Full README**: See [README.md](README.md) for complete documentation

## Quick Test

```bash
# Verify everything works
python demo.py --simple

# Should output:
# - Incident assessment
# - Investigation delegation
# - Root cause determination
# - "Database connection pool exhaustion"
```

**Time to first demo**: < 30 seconds ⚡

**Time to impress judges**: < 2 minutes 🏆

## Emergency Troubleshooting

**Problem**: Import error
**Solution**: Make sure you're in `/Users/henanli/dev/gtc-hackathon`

**Problem**: Python version error
**Solution**: Requires Python 3.7+ (check with `python --version`)

**Problem**: Demo hangs
**Solution**: Ctrl+C and restart

---

## What Makes This Special?

1. **No Setup Required**: Zero dependencies, runs immediately
2. **Observable AI**: You can see how agents think
3. **Realistic**: Based on actual production incident patterns
4. **Extensible**: Easy to add new agents and scenarios
5. **Demo-Ready**: Professional output right out of the box
