topics_covered: This workshop combines the power of NVIDIA Earth-2, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), and 3D Gaussian Splatting to accelerate AI weather modeling and 3D visualizations. You'll learn how to leverage these technologies to downscale models, generate super-resolution outputs, and speed up complex 3D rendering pipelines.

abstract_body: AI-driven climate modeling and weather forecasting rely on complex simulations that can be computationally expensive. To address this challenge, NVIDIA Earth-2 provides a scalable platform for accelerating AI workloads. This workshop focuses on three key technologies: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), a technique for rendering 3D scenes from scratch; 3D Gaussian Splatting, a method for efficiently rendering large datasets; and NVIDIA Earth-2, a platform for accelerating AI workloads. By combining these technologies, participants will learn how to downscale weather models, generate super-resolution outputs, and speed up complex 3D rendering pipelines, enabling more accurate and timely climate and weather simulations.

long_abstract: Climate modeling and weather forecasting are increasingly dependant on AI-driven simulations. However, traditional computing methods can be slow and inaccurate. NVIDIA Earth-2 addresses this challenge by providing a platform for accelerated AI workloads.
