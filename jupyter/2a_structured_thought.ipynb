Specifically, we'd like to know what it can actually reason about, how well it can consider its inputs, and what that suggests for our ability to interact with an external (or even internal) environment. After all, we will want to have some LLM components that are reliable pieces of software as semantic reasoners.\n",

    "If you haven't coded much with LLMs, the previous section may be surprising. If anything, the vagueness with which these systems are able to operate is impressive and the self-corrective behavior is a real game-changer for many conversational applications. With that said, these systems have some inherent weaknesses: \n",
    "- They are influenced to think and act by prompt engineering, but they are not \"forced\" to think in any specific configuration.\n",
    "- The memory systems are easy to taint with message history which steers the dialog into poor directions, opening up opportunities for subtle but compounding quality degredation.\n",
    "- The output is inherently natural language, and does not lend itself to be easily connected with regular software systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "This suggests that we may want to try to lock down our LLM interface and avoid the natural accumulation of state in use cases where multi-turn dialog is not necessary. And when multi-turn dialog is necessary but we still need more control, we may need to restrict and normalize the accumulating context to make sure everything stays in line."

    "- **An Agent That Has To Compute:** If we have a problem that's especially hard to answer with \"thought,\" maybe we can get our LLM to compute the result somehow? Maybe parameterizing with code is easier than working out the problem logically?\n",
    "- **An Agent That Has To Structure:** If we have an interface with especially rigid requirements, maybe we can force it to abide by a format in an even harsher way. Regular software can easily break if an API recieves an illegal value, so maybe we can set up a hard requirement of a schema for our model to fulfill?\n",

    "Recall how we had our expert systems which backbone on our LLM. We said they were leaky and seemed to work pretty well for some classes of input while compromising performance in others. In fact, they are literally fit to form for a particular class of inputs. In the space of natural language (or, even moreso, the space of all possible tokens configurations that could be fed in as input), it may be a bit hard to define what an LLM is really good for, but we can set this kind of structure up:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Canonical Form:** This is the standard form that a particular system accepts as input. In graphics, this may be a T-posed mesh. In algorithms, this may be a function signature. And in chemistry, it may be a standard notation.\n",
    "- **Canonical Grammar:** Assuming a standard form can be defined, this is the set of rules governing what strings are valid or allowable to conform to your given form. This includes a definition of a **\"vocabulary,\"** (primitives of a language) but is stronger because it also governs how the vocabulary instances can be arranged together.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Let's assume we have two leaky abstractions, *Agent 1* and *Agent 2*, which are inherently leaky but are form-fit to their own particular problems. Then:**\n",

    "- We can then assume that if a non-canonical input is fed into an agent, there is a mapping that has to occur (explicitly or implicitly) to get back to the canonical form so that the agent can deal with it as input.\n",
    "    - With regular code, there are usually a lot of checks in place to yell if people pass in illegal arguments. The user and their code are responsible for guaranteeing that arguments are in standard form.\n",
    "    - With semantic reasoning systems, this happens implicitly, but the further away the input drifts from canonical, the harder it is to map to a canonical form.\n",
    "- By this abstraction, two connected expert systems can communicate with one another if the former outputs to the canonical form of the latter. *And for semantic systems, if the output of the former is close enough.*\n",

Many people engineer solutions like that, and have simple post-processing routines which try to error-check and filter out the Python from the non-Python (and to be honest, some library-included systems have gotten pretty good over the past year or so). The canonical form is clearly valid Python with legal syntax and references, but enforcing that for non-trivial inputs requires both a strong LLM, a lot of context injection, and some feedback loops which we will discuss later.\n",

    "Unlike Python code - which requires both static and runtime analysis to legalize - JSON schemas can be validated pretty easily with requirements like \"list of strings,\" \"one of n literal values,\" etc. They are also descriptive enough to encompass function calls, as a function with parameters is just a literal selection followed by a dictionary of named arguments.\n",

    "## **Part 4:** Invoking Structured Output\n",
    "\n",
    "Structured output is incredibly promising and is already widely-adopted in many powerful systems and to various extents. Both LangChain and CrewAI have mechanisms for invoking it, and they go about different approaches for abstracting it. \n",
    "- As per usual, the LangChain primitives enable you to customize exactly how all of the prompt mechanisms are handled, even if it does feel a bit manual. There's still plenty of little details which they are abstracting away, but those are probably for the better.\n",
    "- In contrast, CrewAI has a more abstract wrapper which automates a lot of the prompt injection efforts and makes assumptions that tune it well for the more powerful and feature-rich models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**With that said, the exact mechanisms in which structured output is fulfilled ranges wildly:**\n",
    "- Some LLM servers accept a schema and prompt-engineer the schema into the the system/user prompts to align to the model's training routine.\n",
    "    - In contrast, some LLM servers don't, and require you to manually do the prompt engineering client-side.\n",
    "- Some LLM servers will actually return guaranteed well-formatted JSON responses because they actually limit the generation of next tokens to a valid grammar.\n",
    "    - And some don't, in which case the LLM orchestration library like LangChain has to parse out the legal response.\n",
    "    - And sometimes, this is a glass-half-full good thing because generating the schema without any forethought may push a given model out-of-domain and derail it.\n",
    "- Some systems are happy to take structured output back as historical inputs to help guide the systems.\n",
    "    - And some systems don't do that, either fully rejecting the structured output or \"ignoring\" it, causing knowable or unknowable degradation of your loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, an LLM also generally needs to be trained with structured output or explicit function-calling support in mind, as otherwise (or even regardless), the LLM can still be pushed into out-of-domain generation if it's not supposed to output structured output (even if it is actually forced to).\n",
    "\n",
    "**In other words, this is a fantastic feature, really defines the future of connection to both code and between LLMs, but is also experimentally supported and has inconsistent engineering (or even feasibility) depending on the model and software stack.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Lucky for us, our LLM should support this interface in some way (and a lot of engineering went into making it work reasonably). Let's go ahead and test it out by forcing our LLM to stay within the `\"user_intent\"`/`\"topics_to_ignore\"`/`\"topics_to_address\"` space:\n",

    "...and, as it turns out, this can be easily integrated in with our LLM client, with various potential modifications:\n",
    "- We can just force the LLM to decode within our json grammar, and hope it figures things out.\n",
    "- We can have a server which tells the system about our schema with an automatic prompt injection, which our running endpoint and most open-source systems do not do.\n",
    "- We can also integrate our schema prompt hint with the directions, and this might help with the generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Depending on what features are implemented by the server, the client connector, and the schema, you can run into various fun issues which may not be obvious and manifest as desyncs between our systems.** \n",
    "\n",
    "The following quirks involve a selection of schema styles, specifically when choosing between `str` and `List[str]` fields:\n",
    "- If a newline is generated as part of a string response, it will get cut off.\n",
    "- If a newline is generated as part of a `List[str]` response, it will get interpretted as a new entry.\n",
    "- If the LLM has no idea how to generate a first entry in a `List[str]` output, it will default to outputting an empty list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following quirks manifest from a the desync between how the server and client might handle prompt injection:\n",
    "- If the server gets no hint about the prompt and doesn't force its own prompt injection, **the LLM will be running blind and quality may degrade.**\n",
    "- If the server gets hints from a prompt injection that conflicts from the way the server handles schema outputs, then **quality will likely degrade.**\n",
    "- If the server gets prompt injections from *both* the user and the server, **the instructions will lose self-consistency and the quality will degrade.**\n",
    "- If the model was never trained to perform structured output and is being forced to produce it anyways, **the forced output will likely be out of domain and the quality will degrade.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, there are a lot of things that can go wrong with these kinds of interfaces to cause either catastrophic or subtle loss of quality, and you really need to experiment and look under the hood to figure out exactly what works on a per-model/per-deployment-scheme/per-use-case basis. We can go ahead and test our specific model out and can maybe see what strategies work well for our particular use-case. "

Or maybe, it's just weak in error-correction, since often-times even a slight deviation from \"reasonable\" can derail the system? Or maybe it's just over-reliant on few-shot patterns and under-reliant on what we as the user think is important in the input?\n",
    "\n",
    "For whatever reason, it's just not great... but yet, it \"is\" surprisingly sufficient at some things while also being quite cheap to use. For this reason, it can still be used in low-stakes scenarios and lightweight operations just fine. **However, what isn't as obvious is that ALL MODELS have these same limitations in some regard, at some scale, or for some use-cases.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- You may know that while the top models have great needle-in-a-haystack evaluations, other results have shown that even the best models suffer from severe reasoning degredation as long-context retrieval turns into long-context reasoning (i.e. [**NoLiMa Benchmark**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05167)). In theory, this may be rectified with in-context examples and the right prompt engineering, but a solution is not guaranteed or even deducible outside of trial-and-error.\n",
    "- Even though giant models are capable of ingesting and generating longer-form content, all current systems still have hard max input/output lengths and softer \"effective\" input/output lengths. If you can get an LLM that works on a book scale, there's no reason you should expect it to translate to a repo of books, or a database, or so on.\n",
